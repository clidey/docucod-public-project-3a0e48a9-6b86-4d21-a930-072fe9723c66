# Getting Started with GORM CLI

Welcome to your first step with GORM CLI! This guide walks you through installing the CLI, setting up a basic project structure, and generating your first type-safe query APIs and field helpers. By following these steps, you’ll unlock the power of strongly typed, fluent, and maintainable database access patterns tailored for Go and GORM.

---

## 1. What You'll Achieve

- Install the GORM CLI tool and prepare your Go environment.
- Set up your Go project with initial model and query interface definitions.
- Run the CLI to generate type-safe query APIs and fully featured field helpers.
- Understand the basic workflow to confidently generate and use your first code.

**Estimated Time:** 15–30 minutes

**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Go 1.18 or later installed on your system.
- A working Go project where you can add models and query interfaces.
- Basic familiarity with Go modules and GORM ORM (not mandatory, but helpful).

---

## 3. Installation of GORM CLI

To install the CLI globally, simply run:

```bash
# Install latest release using Go install command
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

**Verification Tip:** Confirm the CLI is available with:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see available commands including `gen` listed.

---

## 4. Setting Up Your Project

### Step 1: Define Your Models

Create Go structs representing your database models. For example, a basic user model:

```go
package models

type User struct {
    ID   uint
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

Place your models in a package (e.g., `models`) inside your project.

### Step 2: Define Query Interfaces

Create interfaces decorated with SQL templates in comments to define your queries with GORM CLI. For instance:

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)

    // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
    FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int) (T, error)
}
```

Note:

- Use Go’s `generics` syntax `[T any]` to parameterize your interface.
- Write SQL queries with GORM CLI DSL placeholders like `@@table` and parameter bindings `@param` directly above methods.

Place this interface and models in the same or accessible package for code generation.

---

## 5. Generating Code with GORM CLI

Run the code generator to transform your interfaces and models into fully typed Go code.

### Command syntax:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` or `--input` points to the directory or file containing your interfaces and models.
- `-o` or `--output` specifies the directory where generated code files will be placed (default is `./g`).

### What Happens:

- GORM CLI reads your annotated interfaces.
- It parses your SQL templated comments.
- Generates type-safe query method implementations.
- Generates field helpers for your model fields for fluent filters and updates.

### Verify success:

- Check the output directory for new `.go` files.
- Confirm files contain generated interfaces, method implementations, and helper structs.

---

## 6. Using Your Generated Code

Once generated, your code enables simple, type-safe queries like so:

```go
// Use generated Query interface
u, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Use field helpers
users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
    Find(ctx)
```

Your generated query methods allow:

- Fetching data with SQL-safe parameters
- Writing filters using generated field helpers like `generated.User.Name.Like(...)`
- Updates with zero-value safety

---

## 7. Sample Step-by-Step Example

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Create model and query interface">
Create a Go file `examples/query.go`:

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}

// models/user.go
package models

type User struct {
    ID   uint
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Run the generator">

Execute in your terminal:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

<Check>Ensure the command runs without errors and generated files appear.</Check>
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Use generated code in your app">

In your application start using:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
fmt.Println(user.Name)
```

This provides you type-safe, compile-time checked access to your database through GORM.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 8. Tips & Best Practices

- Keep your interface files and models together or in easily referenceable packages.
- Use SQL templates in comments on the interface methods with DSL placeholders to maximize code generation clarity.
- Leverage the field helpers for safer queries and updates rather than raw SQL strings.
- Adjust generator output paths with the `-o` flag to organize generated code with your project structure.
- Use the optional `genconfig.Config` (explained in another guide) to customize generation per package.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **`command not found` after install:** Ensure your Go bin path is added to your system `PATH` environment variable.
- **No generated files appear:** Verify your input path `-i` points to correct package or files containing interfaces.
- **Generation errors referencing missing types:** Ensure all imported packages and models are available and compile without error.
- **Using Windows Powershell or shells:** Use quotes appropriately around paths and flags.
