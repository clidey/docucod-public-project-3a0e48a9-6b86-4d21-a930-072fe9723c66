# Installation and Setup

Learn how to install the **GORM CLI**, understand the environment requirements, and prepare your project for code generation. This guide equips you with the prerequisites, installation steps via Go, and initial project preparation needed before your first run of code generation.

---

## 1. Overview

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Install the GORM CLI tool using native Go tooling.
- Verify and meet environment requirements.
- Prepare your project structure and source files for generation.

**Why it matters:** Installing and setting up GORM CLI correctly ensures smooth generation of type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers, removing integration hurdles upfront.

**Estimated time:** 5-10 minutes

**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

## 2. Environment Requirements and Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your system satisfies the following:

- **Go 1.18 or later**: GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in 1.18.
- **Project Structure**: Your Go project should be organized so that query interfaces and models are co-located or in predictable packages/directories.
- **GORM Integration**: Your project must use `gorm.io/gorm` as the ORM.

### Verification Steps

1. Check your Go version:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

   Ensure the output shows at least Go 1.18.

2. Confirm your project contains the model structs and query interfaces ready for code generation.

3. Confirm your modules and dependencies are correctly set up (
   e.g., `go.mod` with `gorm.io/gorm` present).

<Tip>
If your Go version is older than 1.18, upgrade by downloading the latest from the official Go website.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Installing GORM CLI

The recommended installation method uses the native Go `install` command:

```bash
# Install latest version of GORM CLI
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command installs the `gorm` CLI binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`.

### Verification

After installation:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI usage output, confirming a successful install.

<Tip>
Ensure your system's `PATH` environment variable includes your Go bin directory to use the `gorm` command globally.
</Tip>

### Upgrading or Downgrading

To upgrade:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@vX.Y.Z
```

---

## 4. Preparing Your Project for Code Generation

GORM CLI generates code based on your Go source files containing:

- **Query Interfaces** (with SQL templates in comments)
- **Model Structs**

### Organize Your Files

- Typically, keep your interfaces and models in the same package or directory for ease of generation.
- Use proper Go package and import conventions.

### Example Interface Setup

```go
// examples/query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SQL template in comment
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // Custom SQL with dynamic column
  FilterWithColumn(column string, value string) (T, error)
}
```

### Example Model Struct

```go
// examples/models/user.go
package models

type User struct {
  ID int
  Name string
  Age int
}
```

---

## 5. Running Your First Code Generation

Once installed and your project is ready:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/source -o ./path/to/generated
```

- `-i` or `--input`: Path to the directory/file where your query interfaces and models reside.
- `-o` or `--output`: Directory where generated code will be placed (default is `./g`).

### Example

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

This command will:

- Parse your interfaces and structs.
- Generate type-safe query APIs and field helpers based on them.
- Create output Go files in `./generated` preserving your package structure.

---

## 6. Configuration Basics

You can customize generation behavior by declaring a package-level configuration variable of type `genconfig.Config` in your source files, which affects:

- Output path overrides
- Field type mappings for custom field helpers
- Inclusion or exclusion of interfaces and structs

### Minimal Configuration Example

```go
package examples

import (
  "database/sql"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
)

var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "examples/output",
  FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
    sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
  },
}
```

This config will:
- Override output directory to `examples/output`
- Map `sql.NullTime` Go types to the special `field.Time` helper type

For more advanced options, see the [Customizing Generation with genconfig](../advanced-usage/customizing-generation) guide.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Ensure Go Interfaces have SQL Templates:** Your interfaces must define methods with SQL templates in comments for the generator to recognize and process.
- **Package and Import Consistency:** Your imports and package paths must be correct to avoid generation errors.
- **Output Directory:** By default, generated code files are placed in `./g`. Use the `-o` flag to specify a custom path.
- **Context Parameter:** If your method signatures lack `context.Context`, GORM CLI will inject it automatically during generation.

<Tip>
Keep your SQL templates concise and test them iteratively by running generation frequently while you build your interfaces.
</Tip>

## 8. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Setup">
<Accordion title="gorm command not found after installation">
Check that your Go bin directory is added to your system PATH. For example, add the following to your shell profile (e.g., .bashrc or .zshrc):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Restart your terminal or source your profile after updating.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version is less than 1.18">
Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or higher, as GORM CLI relies on generics introduced in Go 1.18.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code generation fails with parsing errors">
Ensure your source Go files compile correctly on their own and contain valid interfaces with proper SQL template comments.

Run `go build ./path/to/source` to verify.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
