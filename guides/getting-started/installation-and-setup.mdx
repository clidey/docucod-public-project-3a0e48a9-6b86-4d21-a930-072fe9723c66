# Installation and Setup

Welcome to the first step in using GORM CLI! This guide will walk you through installing the GORM CLI tool, configuring your environment correctly, and preparing your initial GORM project setup to enable smooth, efficient code generation. By the end of this guide, you'll have the CLI installed and verified, ready to start generating type-safe query APIs and field helpers for your Go projects.

---

## 1. System Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Go version:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher because it relies on Go generics.
- **Operating System:** Supported on all platforms where Go runs (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **GORM ORM:** Make sure your project imports the [GORM ORM package](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) as GORM CLI generates code tightly integrated with it.

### How to Check Go Version

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, please update it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

<Tip>
Using Go 1.18 or newer is mandatory. Older versions won’t support the generated generics-based code.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

The recommended method is via `go install`, which adds the CLI tool to your Go binary path.

### Installation Command

Run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This will install the latest version of GORM CLI and place the `gorm` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go module bin directory.

### Confirm Installation Path

Make sure your system’s `PATH` environment variable includes your Go binary directory. On Unix-like systems this is usually `$HOME/go/bin`.

### Verify Successful Installation

Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI usage information and available commands, confirming the CLI tool is accessible.

<Check>
If the command is not found, consider adding your Go bin directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
</Check>

---

## 3. Initial Configuration

There is no required configuration file to start using GORM CLI, but you can customize code generation by placing a package-level `genconfig.Config` variable in your code (covered in advanced guides).

For basic usage, GORM CLI works out-of-the-box with default settings.

---

## 4. Validating Your Installation

After installation, confirm that GORM CLI works as expected by following these quick validation steps:

### Step 1: Prepare a Sample Interface and Model

Create a simple Go interface with embedded SQL templates and a corresponding model.

Example:

```go
// user.go
package examples

type User struct {
    ID   int
    Name string
}

// query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}
```

### Step 2: Run the Generator

Run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` specifies the input package or file
- `-o` specifies the output directory for generated code

### Step 3: Confirm Generated Files

Check the `generated` directory for files containing the generated query implementation and field helpers.

### Step 4: Build Your Project

Make sure your project compiles with the generated code imported.

## 5. Common Installation Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="'gorm' command not found after installation">
Ensure your Go binary path is in your system PATH environment variable. Restart your terminal session after installation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version too low or incompatible">
Verify your Go version with `go version`. Upgrade to Go 1.18+.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied installing the binary">
Try running the install command with proper permissions or adjust your Go BIN directory permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to execute 'gorm gen' command">
Verify that you are running the command from a valid Go module with your interfaces defined, and that the `input` flag points to the correct file or package.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices for a Smooth Setup

- Use Go Modules in your project for dependency management.
- Organize your interfaces and models logically, ideally in the same or closely related packages.
- Commit your `go.mod` file to ensure consistent build environments.
- Regularly update GORM CLI to access the latest features and fixes.

## 7. Next Steps

After confirming your installation and environment are ready, proceed to:

- [Creating Models & Query Interfaces](/getting-started/first-code-gen/writing-models-interfaces) — Learn how to write the query interfaces and models that GORM CLI uses to generate code.
- [Running the Generator](/getting-started/first-code-gen/running-generator) — Get hands-on with generating code based on your inputs.
- [Using the Generated Code](/getting-started/first-code-gen/first-use) — Understand how to integrate and use the generated type-safe APIs in your Go projects.

<Tip>
Pair this setup guide with system requirements and verification guides to troubleshoot and optimize your environment.
