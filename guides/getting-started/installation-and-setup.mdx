# Installation and Setup

Welcome to the essential first step of adopting GORM CLI: installing the CLI tool, verifying your environment, and preparing your Go project for smooth, efficient code generation. This guide walks you through every stage to get you up and running quickly and confidently.

---

## Workflow Overview

**What this guide helps you accomplish:**
- Install the `gorm` CLI binary on your system
- Verify system requirements are met, especially Go version compatibility
- Set environment variables and PATH for CLI accessibility
- Prepare your Go project to use GORM CLI for generating type-safe query APIs and field helpers

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.18 or later installed and configured
- Familiarity with basic Go tooling and command line

**Expected outcome:**
- You will have the `gorm` CLI installed and ready to run
- Your environment will be verified for compatibility
- Your Go project will be ready for initial code generation commands

**Estimated time:** 5â€“10 minutes

**Difficulty level:** Beginner

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Verify Your Go Environment

Before installing, confirm your Go version meets the minimum requirement.

```bash
go version
```

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18+** because it leverages Go generics.

<Tip>
If your Go version is lower than 1.18, update it by downloading the latest release from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

### 2. Install the GORM CLI

Use the `go install` command to install the CLI. This approach ensures you get the latest stable version.

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command compiles and installs the CLI binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory.

### 3. Add the CLI to Your PATH

Verify that your Go binaries path is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable so you can run `gorm` directly from the terminal.

- On **Linux/macOS**, you can add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- On **Windows**, add `%GOPATH%\bin` or `%GOBIN%` to your system PATH via Environment Variables settings.

After updating PATH, reload your shell or terminal.

<Tip>
You can verify the CLI is accessible by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

This should display the CLI command help information.
</Tip>

### 4. Verify Installation

Run the following to check the installed CLI version and confirm it responds:

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see the version number indicating successful installation.

### 5. Prepare Your Go Project for GORM CLI

Make sure your Go module project is initialized and your models and interfaces are organized:

- Initialize your module if you haven't yet:

```bash
go mod init your/module/path
```

- Organize your model structs and raw SQL interfaces in consistent package folders.

- Optionally, define a `genconfig.Config` in your package to customize generation output.

<Tip>
Co-locating interfaces and model definitions makes GORM CLI auto-discovery seamless.
</Tip>

### 6. Run a Test Code Generation (Optional)

Try running the code generator on a test directory with interfaces and models:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` points to the input directory containing your interfaces
- `-o` specifies the output directory for generated code (default is `./g`)

If successful, generated source files will appear in `./generated`.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep your Go environment up to date** to avoid compatibility issues.
- Add the GORM CLI binary directory permanently to your PATH for convenience.
- Commit versioned generated code into your repository alongside your source.
- Use `genconfig.Config` for advanced customization of output paths and generation scope.

## Common Pitfalls

- *Go version too low:* The CLI silently fails or errors. Verify Go 1.18+
- *PATH not set:* After installation, if `gorm` command not found, check PATH settings
- *Running `gorm gen` without interfaces/models:* No code will be generated
- *Incorrect input directories:* The `-i` flag must point to valid Go files or directories

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Setup">
<Accordion title="I ran `go install` but get 'command not found' when running `gorm`">
Make sure your Go `bin` directory is added to your PATH environment variable and your terminal is reloaded. Check with:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Include `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` in the PATH if missing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Errors related to Go version or modules">
Verify your Go version with `go version`. Update if older than 1.18. Confirm your project uses Go modules (`go.mod` file).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm gen` outputs no files or errors">
Check the input directory contains at least one Go interface file with SQL comments and model structs. Confirm your configuration is valid.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you have installed and set up the CLI, it's time to:

- Learn how to write your query interfaces and model structs for code generation ([Writing Interfaces & Models](../getting-started/first-run-generation/configuration-basics))
- Generate your first code with `gorm gen` ([Generating Code](../getting-started/first-run-generation/generating-code))
- Begin using generated APIs in your project ([Using Generated APIs](../getting-started/first-run-generation/first-usage))

For advanced configuration, explore custom generation settings ([Customizing Code Generation](../getting-started/configuration-validation/customizing-generation)).
