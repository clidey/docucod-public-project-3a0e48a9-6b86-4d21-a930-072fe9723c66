# Installation & Setup Guide for GORM CLI

## Workflow Overview

**What This Guide Helps You Accomplish**

This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool, verifying your environment setup, and performing your first code generation. You'll learn how to prepare your system for GORM CLI (including Go generics prerequisites), install the CLI, validate the installation, run a minimal example generation, and confirm the output is usable.

**Prerequisites**

- Go programming language version 1.18 or higher (for generics support).
- Access to your system terminal / command line.
- GOPATH and PATH environment variables correctly configured.

**Expected Outcome**

- GORM CLI installed and accessible from your terminal.
- Confirmation that the CLI runs without error.
- Successful generation of code from a sample interface.
- Understanding of how to invoke code generation with input and output paths.

**Time Estimate**

~10–15 minutes for a first-time setup.

**Difficulty Level**

Beginner to Intermediate — basic familiarity with Go command line tooling is helpful.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Verify Go Environment and Version

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets Go version requirements.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```
3. Confirm the output shows `go version go1.18` or newer.

<Tip>
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ to leverage Go generics. If your version is older, upgrade Go before proceeding.
</Tip>

### 2. Install GORM CLI

Install the CLI globally using the `go install` command.

1. Run this command:

   ```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
   ```

2. Once complete, ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your system's `PATH` environment variable. This makes the `gorm` executable accessible globally.

3. To verify installation, run:

   ```bash
   gorm --help
   ```

   You should see CLI help output describing available commands.

<Note>
If you encounter a “command not found” error, check that your Go bin directory is added to `PATH`. For example, add `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to your shell profile.
</Note>

### 3. Prepare a Sample Interface and Model for Code Generation

Create or use an existing Go directory containing your model structs and SQL template interfaces. As a minimal example, define a query interface and a model struct in a folder (e.g., `examples/`):

```go
// examples/query.go
package examples

// Query interface with SQL template comments
// Enables type-safe query generation

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}

// examples/models/user.go
package examples

type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

This simple interface declares a method to fetch by id, using GORM CLI’s templating directives.

### 4. Run the GORM CLI Code Generator

Use the `gorm gen` command to generate query and field helper code.

1. Navigate to your project root (where the `examples/` folder resides).
2. Run the command:

   ```bash
   gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
   ```

   - `-i` or `--input`: path to the folder or file with your interfaces and models.
   - `-o` or `--output`: directory to place generated code (default `./g`).

3. Upon successful completion, check the `generated` folder for new Go source files.

<Check>
If the generation fails, confirm the input path contains valid Go code with interfaces annotated with SQL templates. Also ensure no syntax errors exist in your source files.
</Check>

### 5. Validate the Generated Code

Integrate the generated code into your Go project:

- Import the generated package.
- Use the generated query interfaces and field helpers as shown:

```go
// Using generated code
import (
  "context"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "yourmodule/generated"
  "yourmodule/examples"
)

func exampleUsage(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()

  user, err := generated.Query[examples.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  fmt.Println(user)
  return nil
}
```

Successfully invoking generated query methods confirms your setup is correct.

## Examples & Commands

```bash
# Verify Go version
$ go version
# Install GORM CLI
$ go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
# Generate code from interfaces
$ gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Minimal interface example:

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}

package examples

type User struct {
  ID uint
  Name string
  Age int
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Command not found after installation:** Ensure GOPATH/bin is added to your system PATH.
- **Go version below 1.18:** Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or newer.
- **Generation errors:** Check that your input path points to valid Go files; interfaces must have SQL template comments.
- **Empty or missing output:** Confirm the output directory is writable and your interfaces have methods with correct SQL template annotations.

### Best Practices

- Place your model structs and query interfaces in the same package or directory to ease generation.
- Use meaningful method comments with SQL templates to ensure the generator produces accurate queries.
- Use the `-o` flag to organize your generated code separately but within module import paths.

### Performance & Environment

- Generating in large codebases might take longer; start with subsets of interfaces.
- Keep your Go module tidy and dependencies resolved before generation.
