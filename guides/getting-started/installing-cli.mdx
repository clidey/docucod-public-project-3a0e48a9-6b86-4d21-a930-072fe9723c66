# Installing the GORM CLI

## Workflow Overview

The purpose of this guide is to help you install the GORM CLI on your system and validate that the installation was successful. You’ll get clear instructions on Go version requirements, the installation command, and how to quickly confirm the CLI is accessible and working.

### Prerequisites

- Go programming language installed, version **1.18 or higher** (required for generics support).
- Access to your system’s terminal or command line interface.
- Basic knowledge of Go tooling such as `go install`.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this guide, you will have the GORM CLI installed and verified on your machine, ready to generate type-safe APIs and field helpers for your GORM projects.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 5-10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner

---

## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Verify Your Go Version

Ensure your installed Go version meets the requirement of 1.18 or later.

```bash
go version
```

- If your Go version is below 1.18, update it before proceeding.

### 2. Install the GORM CLI Using the `go install` Command

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This fetches and installs the latest version of the GORM CLI.
- The CLI binary will be placed in your Go bin directory.

### 3. Add Go Bin Directory to Your PATH (If Needed)

If the `gorm` command is not recognized after installation, you may need to add your Go bin directory to your system’s PATH.

- For Unix/Linux/macOS, typically add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- For Windows, add the Go bin path (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`) to the System Environment Variables PATH.

### 4. Verify CLI Installation

Check if the CLI is accessible and responding by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- You should see a help message showing available commands like `gen`.

### 5. (Optional) Test Basic CLI Generation Command

Use a minimal example input to ensure the CLI runs without errors.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

- This command generates code based on example interfaces in the `examples/query.go` file.
- Make sure the path exists or adjust with your source file path.

- If the command completes without errors and generates files under `./generated`, your installation is validated.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue: `gorm` Command Not Found

- Confirm that Go’s bin directory is in your PATH.
- Reopen your terminal or source your shell profile after adding the bin path.

### Issue: Go Version Below 1.18

- Update Go to latest stable version from [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl).
- Re-run the install command after updating.

### Issue: Permission Denied During Installation

- Verify you have write access to your Go bin directory.
- Consider running the install command with proper permissions or as your user.

### Issue: Code Generation Fails or No Output

- Verify input path with `-i` points to a valid Go interface file with SQL annotations.
- Confirm the output directory exists or that you have permission to create it.
- Check for error messages in the terminal for guidance.

<Tip>
If you encounter errors, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation Issues guide](/getting-started/setup-basics/troubleshooting-install) for detailed diagnostic steps.

## Best Practices

- Always ensure your Go environment is updated to leverage the latest CLI features.
- Use absolute paths for input and output flags during `gorm gen` to avoid confusion.
- Regularly check the CLI version and update by reinstalling using `go install`.

---

## Quick Validation Summary

- Run `go version` and confirm >= 1.18
- Run `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`
- Add Go bin to PATH if necessary
- Verify by running `gorm --help`
- Try a test generation command (`gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated`)
