# Installation & Quick Start

Welcome to GORM CLI! This guide walks you through installing the CLI tool, preparing your environment, and generating your very first type-safe query and field helper code with just a few commands. By following these steps, you'll rapidly move from interface/model definitions to using generated, compile-time-safe APIs in your Go projects.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
- Install the GORM CLI tool for code generation
- Set up your Go environment to work with GORM CLI
- Define your first query interface with SQL templates and model structs
- Generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers
- Use the generated code to run queries confidently with compile-time safety

### Prerequisites
- Go programming environment with version 1.18 or higher (generics supported)
- A Go project initialized with GORM (`gorm.io/gorm`) installed
- Basic knowledge of Go interfaces, structs, and working with GORM query models

### Expected Outcome
- GORM CLI installed on your system
- Generated code files containing query interfaces and field helpers
- A working Go example that queries a database using the generated APIs

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate (developer familiar with Go basics)

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install the GORM CLI Tool

Install the CLI tool using the Go installer command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

<Tip>
Ensure your `GOPATH` bin directory is in your system's PATH environment variable so you can run `gorm` from any terminal.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Define Your Query Interface and Models

Create Go files for your query interface and your models inside your project, preferably under the same package or directory.

#### Example query interface (`query.go`):

```go
// query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SQL template: SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // Where clause with dynamic SQL
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

#### Example model (`user.go`):

```go
// user.go
package examples

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

### Step 3: Generate Code Using the CLI

Run the generation command pointing to your interfaces directory and specifying an output directory for generated code.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` (`--input`) points to the directory/file containing your query interfaces
- `-o` (`--output`) specifies where the generated Go files will be created

<Tip>
If you do not specify `-o`, generated files default to `./g`.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Use the Generated APIs in Your Application

Import the generated code and use the fluent, type-safe query functions.

Example usage:

```go
// Query user by ID
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Query users by age greater than 18
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
```

<Tip>
The generated APIs provide field helpers such as `.Eq()`, `.Lt()`, `.Gt()`, and `.Set()` for building fluent queries and updates with compile-time safety.
</Tip>

## 3. Real-World Usage Examples

### Defining a Query Interface with SQL Templates

You can embed SQL templates inside Go interface method comments to generate concrete, type-safe query methods.

```go
// Query interface example

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE name=@name AND age=@age
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

### Using Generated Field Helpers for Conditions

After generation, you get easy-to-use predicates for fields:

```go
// Query users with age between 18 and 65
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)).
  Find(ctx)

// Increment user's age by 1
err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")).
  Set(generated.User.Age.Incr(1)).
  Update(ctx)
```

### Creating and Updating Associations

You can also create and manage associations using generated helpers:

```go
// Create a new user with an associated pet
err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

## 4. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues

- **`gorm` command not found:** Check that your Go bin path is in your system PATH and that the install succeeded.
- **No output files generated:** Confirm you provided the correct input path (`-i`) and that interfaces have SQL template comments.
- **Compiler errors in generated code:** Ensure your Go version is 1.18+ (for generics support).
- **SQL template syntax errors:** Review your SQL templates for valid syntax and proper placeholder usage.

### Tips for Success

- Keep interfaces and model structs in the same package for easier generation.
- Use the built-in field helpers to avoid mistakes and improve readability.
- Always check the generated code; it can help you understand how SQL templates translate.
- Use `genconfig.Config` to customize generation if needed (advanced).

## Summary

This page guided you step-by-step through the installation of the GORM CLI tool, setting up your environment, and a fast path to generating and using your first type-safe query and field helper APIs. You learned how to define interfaces with embedded SQL templates, generate code via the `gorm gen` command, and run queries with the generated fluent API.

For immediate success, ensure you have Go 1.18+, follow the sample interface/model examples, and inspect generated files. This foundation opens the door to more advanced customization and integration workflows documented elsewhere.
