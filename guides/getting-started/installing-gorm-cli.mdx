# Installing and Setting Up GORM CLI

This guide provides a clear, step-by-step walkthrough to help you install the GORM CLI tool, prepare your Go environment, and set up your project structure for efficient type-safe code generation. By following these steps, you will be ready to generate fluent, compile-time safe query APIs and field helpers tailored for your GORM projects.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Successfully install the GORM CLI tool on your system
- Verify your Go environment meets GORM CLI’s requirements
- Understand and prepare your project layout for seamless code generation
- Run your first validation to confirm GORM CLI is properly set up

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation and setup, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Go 1.18 or higher** installed on your system (supports generics, required by GORM CLI)
- Your system's **`GOPATH` and `PATH`** environment variables correctly configured to include Go binaries
- Basic familiarity with Go modules and project structure

If you have not confirmed your environment yet, please see the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-requirements) documentation.

---

## Step 1: Install GORM CLI

The GORM CLI tool is installed using the Go command line toolchain. This approach ensures you get the latest stable version.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
   ```

3. This command downloads and installs the `gorm` binary into your Go bin directory.

### Verification

After installation, verify that the CLI tool is installed and accessible by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see a help output describing available commands, including the `gen` command for code generation.

<Tip>
If `gorm` is not found, ensure your Go bin directory is added to the system `PATH`.
Check your Go bin path with `go env GOPATH` and add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Prepare Your Project Structure

GORM CLI generates code by scanning Go interfaces with SQL annotations and model structs in your project packages or directories.

### Recommended Project Layout

Organize your code to keep interfaces and models cleanly grouped:

```plaintext
your-project/
 ├── models/           # Your model structs (e.g., User.go)
 ├── queries/          # Query interfaces with SQL template comments
 ├── generated/        # Output directory for generated code
 └── main.go           # Application entry
```

- Keep query interfaces and models together or in related directories to simplify generation inputs.
- Plan your output directory (`generated/` is a common choice).

### Configure Optional Generation Settings

You can optionally declare a `genconfig.Config` variable in the package where your interfaces/models live to customize:

- Output path for generated code
- Field type mappings and helper associations
- Inclusion or exclusion filters for interfaces or structs

Example configuration snippet:

```go
package examples

import (
  "database/sql"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "generated", // Output generated code here
  FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
    sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
  },
}
```

For details, see the guide on [Configuring Code Generation](../getting-started/first-steps/configuration-setup).

---

## Step 3: Verify Your Installation

Validation ensures your installed GORM CLI tool works and your environment is ready.

### Run the Help Command

```bash
gorm --help
```

Check that the CLI lists the `gen` subcommand, key flags, and basic usage.

### Check Go Version

Ensure you have Go 1.18 or above:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is older, update before proceeding.

### Confirm Your Project Setup

If you have prepared your sample model and query interface (e.g., as shown in the [Quickstart Workflow](../overview/feature-highlights-and-getting-started/quickstart)), then you are ready for the next step of generating code.

---

## Step 4: Next Steps

After completion of your installation and setup, proceed to:

- **Quick Start: Your First Code Generation** — learn how to write your first query interface and generate code
- **Configuration & Customization** — customize your generation settings for your project needs
- **Validating the Generated Code** — verify your generated code works as expected in your project

These guides will help you move rapidly from installation to productive use of GORM CLI.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or setup, consider the following common problems:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="`gorm` command not found after install">
- Verify your `GOPATH/bin` directory is in your system `PATH`.
- Reopen your terminal or reload your environment variables.
- Run `go env GOPATH` to find your bin location.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version too old">
- GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to use of generics.
- Update your Go installation following official Go documentation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied or install errors">
- Run the install command without `sudo` unless you installed Go with root permissions.
- Ensure your Go installation and workspace directories have correct permissions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [Common Installation Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting/common-install-errors).

## Summary

This guide brought you from zero to ready with GORM CLI installation and setup. You have successfully:

- Installed the CLI tool using the Go toolchain
- Prepared your project structure for code generation
- Verified your Go environment and CLI installation

Continue your GORM CLI journey by exploring the next guides in generating and using type-safe query APIs and model helpers.
