# Installation & CLI Setup

This guide walks you through the complete installation and initial setup of the GORM CLI tool. You'll learn how to install the CLI, verify the installation, run your first commands, and troubleshoot common issues to ensure a smooth start.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve
This guide helps you install the GORM CLI tool, verify it is correctly set up in your environment, and run initial commands to generate code from your Go interfaces and models.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or higher must be installed on your system.
- Your environment's PATH configured to find Go binaries.
- Basic familiarity with Go command-line tools.

### Expected Outcome
- GORM CLI installed and accessible from your terminal.
- Confirmation that the CLI commands respond correctly.
- Ability to run the `gorm gen` code generator with your inputs.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5-10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Go Environment

Ensure Go 1.18+ is installed:
```bash
go version
```
Expected output example:
```
go version go1.20.3 linux/amd64
```

If Go is not installed or the version is below 1.18, please install or upgrade Go before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Install GORM CLI

Use the Go toolchain to install the latest GORM CLI binary:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This installs the `gorm` executable to your Go binary path (commonly `$GOPATH/bin`).

---

### Step 3: Ensure `gorm` is in your System PATH

Confirm that the Go bin directory is in your shell's PATH environment variable:

```bash
which gorm
```

If the command does not return a path, add Go's bin directory to your PATH. Example for Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Make this change permanent by adding it to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

---

### Step 4: Verify GORM CLI Installation

Check the CLI is correctly installed and available:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output shows usage summary and available commands. At minimum, you should see the `gen` command listed:

```shell
Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from Go interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```

---

### Step 5: Run the Code Generator Command

The primary command for generating code is `gen`. To run it, you need:

- An input Go file or directory containing interface definitions with SQL templates.
- (Optional) An output directory for generated code.

Basic usage:

```bash
gorm gen -i path/to/interfaces -o path/to/generated
```

Example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Successful execution prints:

```
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

---

### Step 6: Confirm Generated Code

After running the generator, check the output directory:

- Files with generated query APIs and field helpers should be present.
- The folder structure reflects the input directory hierarchy.

You can now integrate these generated files into your Go project and start writing type-safe queries.

---

## 3. Examples & Usage

### Installing and Running the Generator

1. Install CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

2. Run generator with examples package:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

3. Import and use generated code in your project:

```go
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

---

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Installation Issues

- **`gorm` command not found:** Make sure Go's bin directory is in your PATH.

- **Go version too low:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer.

- **Permission denied when installing:** Check your system's Go installation permissions or try running with elevated privileges if necessary.

### Generator Command Issues

- **Missing input path (`-i` flag):** The `-i` input flag is required. Use `gorm gen -h` to see command usage.

- **Invalid input path:** Ensure the input directory or file exists and contains Go interfaces with correct annotations.

- **Output path not existing:** The generator creates the output directory if it does not exist.

### Best Practices

- Keep your query interfaces and models in well-structured Go packages for clean code generation.
- Use the optional `genconfig.Config` (see related Configuration & Customization guide) to tailor generation paths and filters.

<Tip>
Always verify your Go environment and PATH settings before installing CLI tools. This prevents common 'command not found' errors and smooths your setup experience.
</Tip>

<Note>
The GORM CLI depends heavily on your projectâ€™s Go code structure. Properly organizing interfaces and models ensures accurate, reliable code generation.
</Note>

<Warning>
Do not skip verifying your Go version. Older versions will cause cryptic errors or installation failures.
