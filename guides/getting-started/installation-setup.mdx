# Installation & Initial Setup

## Overview
This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool, setting up your Go project environment, and verifying everything is ready for generating type-safe code with GORM CLI. You'll learn how to install the tool, configure your Go workspace properly, and run initial commands to confirm your setup is correct.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Install the GORM CLI globally in your Go environment.
- Prepare your Go project to integrate with GORM CLI.
- Verify your Go version meets the requirements.
- Confirm the CLI tool is accessible and functioning.

Following this guide ensures a smooth and error-free start to using GORM CLI for code generation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Go programming environment installed**: Go version 1.18 or higher is required, as GORM CLI uses Go generics.
- **Go binary directory in PATH**: The `go install` command places binaries in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`; ensure this path is included in your system's PATH to run `gorm` commands directly.
- **Internet connection** to download the GORM CLI module.

> Tip: Check your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

It must print a version >= `go1.18`.

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install GORM CLI

Run the following command to install the latest GORM CLI binary:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This downloads and installs the CLI as an executable named `gorm` into your Go bin directory.

### 2. Verify Installation

After installing, confirm the CLI is available globally:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see usage information about the `gorm` command, including available subcommands such as `gen`.

> Note: If you get `command not found`, ensure your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`) is in your system PATH.

### 3. Confirm Go Version Compatibility

Since GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ (due to generics usage), check your Go version with:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is older, update your Go installation before proceeding.

---

## Configuring Your Go Project

GORM CLI generates code based on your Go packages that contain model structs and annotated query interfaces.

### Project Preparation Recommendations

- Ensure your project uses Go modules (`go.mod` file present).
- Organize your model structs and query interface files in the same or nested packages/directories, so the generator can process them smoothly.
- The CLI uses Go import paths and filesystem paths; consistent structure avoids configuration complexity.

> Tip: A typical project structure looks like:

```plaintext
/my-project
  /models
    user.go
  /queries
    user_query.go
```

Or combined:

```plaintext
/my-project
  user.go
  user_query.go
```

---

## Using the CLI for Initial Setup Verification

### 1. Run a Sample Generation Command

Use the CLI to generate code from your interfaces early, even if minimal. Place interfaces in a directory and run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

- `-i`: input path to Go package containing your annotated interfaces
- `-o`: output directory where generated code will be placed (defaults to `./g`)

Successful execution indicates the CLI is correctly installed and your environment is configured.

### 2. Check Generated Files

Navigate to the output directory (default `./g` or the folder you specified) and verify the expected generated Go files appear.

### 3. Integrate Generated Code

After generation, import and use the generated packages as described in the Quickstart and Further Guides.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Go Version**: Stay updated with Go versions >= 1.18 for compatibility and performance improvements.
- **PATH Setup**: Add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to your system PATH to make `gorm` command globally accessible.
- **Module Awareness**: Run `go mod tidy` in your project root after generating code to keep dependencies clean.
- **Output Path**: Choose a dedicated output directory for generated code to keep generated files organized separately.

Set the environment variable `GOBIN` if you want to control where Go places binaries when installing tools.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation and Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
Update your Go installation to 1.18 or later. Older Go versions do not support generics required by GORM CLI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm` command not found after installation">
Verify that your Go bin directory (default `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) is added to your PATH environment variable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied during installation">
Run the install command with appropriate permissions or adjust your file system permissions for Go paths.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generation fails with errors about input path">
Double check that the `-i` flag points to a valid directory containing Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates.

## Next Steps

Once the CLI is installed and verified, proceed to:

- [Prepare Your Project & Quickstart](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/config-first-use/project-structure-and-quickstart) — Organize your model and interface files properly.
- [Generate Your First Code](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/config-first-use/running-cli-generate) — Run the CLI to create type-safe APIs.
- [Validate & Use Your Generated APIs](https://your-docs-domain/getting-started/config-first-use/validate-generated-code) — Build and test the generated code.

Refer to detailed configuration documentation to customize generation paths and behaviors.
