# Installation & Initial Setup

This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool, preparing your Go project environment, and performing basic verification steps to ensure your setup is ready. You'll also learn how to organize your Go models and query interfaces for seamless code generation.

---

## 1. Installation & Setup Workflow Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
- Install the GORM CLI tool using Go tooling.
- Prepare your Go project directory with models and query interfaces.
- Run a basic code generation command to verify installation.

### Prerequisites
- Go version 1.18 or higher installed on your system.
- A working Go module project (`go.mod` initialized).
- Network access to download modules.

### Expected Outcome
- GORM CLI installed and accessible via command line.
- A minimal interface and model set defined and ready for code generation.
- Generated type-safe query APIs and field helpers created in your output directory.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-20 minutes depending on system and familiarity.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Go Environment

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to check your Go version:

```bash
 go version
```

3. Confirm output shows Go 1.18 or newer.

<Tip>
If your Go version is older, upgrade to Go 1.18+ before proceeding to benefit from generics and other language features required by GORM CLI.
</Tip>

---

### Step 2: Install GORM CLI

Run the following command to install the CLI tool:

```bash
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads and installs the `gorm` binary to `$GOPATH/bin` or your Go bin directory.

**Verify installation:**

```bash
 gorm version
```

You should see the tool's version printed.

<Check>
If "command not found" occurs, ensure your Go bin directory is in your system PATH.
</Check>

---

### Step 3: Prepare Your Go Project Structure

Organize your source files to define:

- **Models**: Go structs representing database tables.
- **Query Interfaces**: Interfaces with SQL template method comments.

A common practice:

```
myproject/
  ├── models/
  │    └── user.go
  ├── queries/
  │    └── user_query.go
  ├── go.mod
```

**Example Model:**

```go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name string
    Age int
}
```

**Example Query Interface:**

```go
package queries

// Query defines SQL template method comments for user queries
// Each method includes raw SQL or template directives.
type Query[T any] interface {
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)

    // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
    FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

<Tip>
Place your query interface and related models in the same package or directory to simplify generation.
</Tip>

---

### Step 4: Run Code Generation

With your model and interface ready, run the CLI generator:

```bash
 gorm gen -i ./queries -o ./generated
```

- `-i` specifies the input directory containing your Go source files with query interfaces and models.
- `-o` specifies the output directory for generated files.

You should see logs indicating generated files.

<Tip>
Use relative paths based on your current terminal directory. If you want default output directory, omit `-o`.
</Tip>

---

### Step 5: Verify Generated Code

Check the output directory (e.g., `./generated`) for generated Go files.

You should find:
- Type-safe query interface implementations.
- Model-driven field helper variables and types.

Attempt to build your project to verify:

```bash
 go build ./generated
```

No errors means setup and code generation were successful.

---

## 3. Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Models and Queries in Separate Packages:** Make sure your models import paths and package names are consistent to avoid generation issues.
- **Avoid Generating on Empty Input:** Ensure input directory passed to `-i` contains Go files with valid interfaces.
- **Avoid Naming Conflicts:** Keep output directory separate from input to prevent overwrite or confusion.
- **File-Level Configurations:** You can fine-tune generation using a `genconfig.Config` variable in your package (see advanced docs).

<Tip>
Define a minimal `genconfig.Config` to control where generated code lands or to filter which interfaces/structs are included.
</Tip>

## 4. Example Walkthrough

### Minimal Setup Example

**models/user.go**
```go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

**queries/query.go**
```go
package queries

type Query[T any] interface {
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}
```

### Generate Code

```bash
gorm gen -i ./queries -o ./generated
```

### Use in Your Code

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/generated"
    "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
    db, _ := gorm.Open(...)
    ctx := context.Background()

    user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error fetching user:", err)
    }
    fmt.Println("User:", user)
}
```

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Issue: 'gorm' command not found after installation">
Ensure your Go binary path (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is included in your system `PATH` variable. Restart your terminal and retry.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Issue: No generated files produced">
- Confirm your input directory contains Go files with correctly annotated interfaces.
- Check that the interfaces contain SQL template comments.
- Run with verbose logging or review output for error messages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Issue: Build errors in generated code">
- Make sure the Go version is 1.18 or higher.
- Confirm your model and query packages are correctly imported.
- Check for typos or missing imports in your source files.
- Verify no conflicting packages or files exist in the output folder.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Issue: Unknown SQL template errors during generation">
