# Installation & Setup

## Overview

This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool, ensuring your development environment meets all prerequisites, and setting up your Go project to generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers. By following these instructions, you’ll be prepared to use GORM CLI for seamless code generation and integration with GORM.

---

## What You Will Accomplish

- Install the GORM CLI binary using the recommended approach
- Configure your system PATH to access the CLI globally
- Verify system requirements and Go toolchain readiness
- Prepare your Go project directory structure for efficient code generation
- Understand key installation parameters and options

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Go programming language installed, version 1.18 or above
- GOPATH and GOBIN configured properly, or Go 1.18+ module-aware installation
- Network access to download the CLI module from the public Go repository
- A Go project with models and interfaces defined or ready for creation

Refer to the **[System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-introduction/requirements)** guide for detailed environment checks.

---

## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 1. Confirm Go Version

Ensure your Go version supports generics (1.18+):

```bash
go version
```

You should see output like `go version go1.18 linux/amd64` or newer.

---

### 2. Install GORM CLI Using `go install`

Run the recommended install command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This downloads and installs the `gorm` executable to your `$GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

---

### 3. Add GORM CLI to Your PATH

Make sure the installation directory is included in your system PATH environment variable.

- On Linux/macOS, typically add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- On Windows, add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your system PATH via environment variable settings.

Reload your shell or open a new terminal session.

---

### 4. Verify GORM CLI Installation

Check that the `gorm` command runs and displays help:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output includes usage instructions and flags.

---

### 5. Prepare Your Go Project for Code Generation

Organize your project to include:

- **Model structs:** Your database models, e.g. `User`, `Account` structs.
- **Query interfaces:** Interfaces with method signatures annotated by SQL template comments.

Place your models and interfaces in a dedicated package or folder to keep your project clean.

Example structure:

```
/myproject
  /models
    user.go
    account.go
  /queries
    query.go
```

Refer to **[Prepare Your Project](../getting-started/first-usage-configuration/project-structure)** guide for best practices.

---

### 6. Run the Generator

After installation and preparation, generate the code:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./queries -o ./generated
```

- `-i` points to your interfaces package or file
- `-o` sets the output directory for generated files (default is `./g` if omitted)

You will see logs showing generated files if successful.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Keep interfaces focused on database operations with clear method signatures and SQL comments.
- Use the default output directory `./g` initially to isolate generated code.
- Incrementally verify generated code after initial runs.
- Use `genconfig.Config` for optional customization if default settings don’t suit your project.

Example minimal config for output path:

```go
package yourpkg

import "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "generated",
}
```

- Avoid mixing CLI-generated code and handwritten code in the same folder to prevent overwrites.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<Tip>
If `gorm` command is not found after installation, verify your PATH includes Go's bin directory. Run `echo $PATH` and check for `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Installation may fail if internet access is unavailable or Go proxy settings block module resolution. Consider configuring `GOPROXY` environment variable.
</Warning>

<Note>
For permission errors during installation, ensure you have write access to Go's bin directory or use a user-local GOPATH.
</Note>

---

## Next Steps

- Validate your installation and generated code with the **[Validate Your Installation](../getting-started/setup-introduction/validate-install)** guide.
- Consult **[Troubleshooting Setup Issues](../getting-started/setup-introduction/troubleshooting)** if you encounter errors.
- Start **[Preparing Your Project](../getting-started/first-usage-configuration/project-structure)** to arrange your code for best generator support.
- Explore the **[Quickstart: Code Generation Workflow](../guides/getting-started/quickstart-code-generation)** for hands-on usage.
