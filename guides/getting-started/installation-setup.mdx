# Installation & Setup

This guide walks you through installing GORM CLI, preparing your Go environment, and setting up your project directory for seamless code generation. Following these steps guarantees a strong foundation to leverage GORM CLI’s powerful generation capabilities.

---

## 1. Overview

### What You Will Achieve
By completing this guide, you will have installed the GORM CLI tool, configured your Go environment properly, and prepared a project directory structured to generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers.

### Prerequisites
- Go version 1.18 or higher installed and configured
- Working knowledge of Go modules and basic project structure
- Access to your terminal or command prompt with internet connectivity

### Expected Outcome
- GORM CLI installed and accessible from your command line
- Initial project structure ready for defining your models and interfaces
- Ability to run the `gorm gen` command successfully to generate code

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Verify Go Version
Ensure your Go environment meets the minimum version requirement.

```bash
go version
```

- **Expected result:** Output should show `go version go1.18` or later.
- If your Go version is older, download and install the latest Go from [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/).

---

### Step 2: Install GORM CLI
Use the Go toolchain to install the CLI tool globally on your system.

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command downloads and installs the `gorm` executable to your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory.
- Make sure that this directory is included in your system `PATH` to invoke `gorm` from anywhere.

---

### Step 3: Confirm Installation
Verify the CLI tool is installed correctly:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- You should see the help output describing various commands like `gen`.
- If the command is not found, review your PATH settings.

---

### Step 4: Prepare Your Go Project Directory

Create a new Go module or navigate to your existing project:

```bash
mkdir mygormproject && cd mygormproject
go mod init github.com/yourusername/mygormproject
```

- This initializes a module which enables dependency management.
- Organize your project with folders for interfaces, models, and generated code, for example:

```
mygormproject/
  ├── models/
  ├── interfaces/
  ├── generated/
  └── go.mod
```

---

### Step 5: Place Your Model and Interface Code

- Define your GORM model structs inside the `models` directory.
- Write query interfaces with SQL template annotations inside the `interfaces` directory.

Example:

```go
// models/user.go
package models

type User struct {
    ID   uint
    Name string
    Age  int
}

// interfaces/user_query.go
package interfaces

// UserQuery defines query methods with SQL templates
// query methods are annotated in comments
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
interface UserQuery {
    GetByID(id int) (models.User, error)
}
```

---

### Step 6: Configure Optional Generation Settings

GORM CLI automatically detects config files named `genconfig.Config` in your packages to customize generation, including path overrides, include/exclude filters, and field type mappings.

Example config to place in your package, e.g., `interfaces/config.go`:

```go
package interfaces

import "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "generated",
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"UserQuery"},
}
```

---

### Step 7: Run GORM CLI Code Generation

Invoke the CLI by specifying the input directory with interfaces and the output directory for generated code:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./interfaces -o ./generated
```

- This command analyzes your interfaces and models, then generates type-safe query APIs and field helpers inside `generated`.
- Check the CLI output to confirm successful generation.

---

### Step 8: Verify Generated Files

- Explore the `generated` directory to review generated Go source files.
- They should include implementations for your query interfaces and field helper structs representing your models.

---

## 3. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep your model and interface packages separate:** This encourages clarity and easier management.
- **Use config files for large projects:** To include/exclude specific interfaces or structs and customize outputs.
- **Version your CLI:** Monitor changes in the CLI for improvements and breaking changes.
- **Run generation regularly:** Integrate `gorm gen` into your build or CI pipelines to keep generated code up to date.

## 4. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Setup">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
<p>If after `go install`, the CLI command `gorm` is not found, ensure your `GOPATH/bin` or `GOBIN` is included in your PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>Example for bash:
<code>export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin</code></p>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Incompatibility">
<p>GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+. Running <code>go version</code> shows your installed version. Upgrade Go if older.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">golang.org/dl/</a> for latest releases.</p>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File Structure Not Detected or No Output">
<p>Verify you pointed the CLI to the correct input path containing your interfaces (<code>-i</code>) and that your package contains interfaces with SQL template annotations or config files.</p>
<p>Also check that no exclusion configuration is filtering out all your interfaces or structs.</p>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps

- After finishing setup, proceed to **[Minimal Configuration & Project Setup](../first-generation/basic-configuration)** to learn how to define models and interfaces effectively.
- Run your first generation command by following the **[Running Your First Code Generation](../first-generation/first-generation-command)** guide.
- Learn to integrate and use the generated APIs with **[Using the Generated APIs](../first-generation/using-generated-code)**.

Refer to the **[Troubleshooting & Common Issues](../first-generation/troubleshooting)** guide for help if any challenges arise.
