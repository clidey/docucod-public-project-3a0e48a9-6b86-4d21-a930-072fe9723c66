# Customization and Generation Config

Tailor your GORM CLI code generation process precisely with package-level configuration using `genconfig.Config`. This guide walks you through customizing output paths, mapping Go types and field tags to custom field helpers, controlling generation scopes at file vs. package level, and using include/exclude rules for fine-grained filtering.

---

## What This Guide Covers

- How to declare and use `genconfig.Config` for per-package generation customization
- Overriding default output paths for generated files
- Mapping Go types and `gen:"..."` tags to field helper implementations
- Controlling whether configuration applies only to a single file or an entire package
- Including or excluding specific interface and struct types using pattern matching and literal type selectors
- Best practices and troubleshooting tips to avoid common pitfalls

---

## Why Customize Generation?

By default, GORM CLI generates code using sane defaults, but customization lets you:

- Organize generated code in project-specific directories (`OutPath` override)
- Use tailored field helpers for specialized SQL column types like JSON or nullable time
- Control which interfaces and structs get generated in larger codebases
- Manage configuration at file-level granularity for unique build structures

This flexibility empowers teams to integrate GORM CLI seamlessly into diverse Go projects.

---

## Declaring `genconfig.Config`

Place a variable with type `genconfig.Config` at package-level in any Go source file within the package you want to generate. The generator automatically discovers and applies this configuration.

```go
package yourpackage

import (
    "database/sql"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

// Customize generation behavior per package
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "generated/output", // Override CLI output directory for this package

    // Map Go native types to custom typed field helpers
    FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
        sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
    },

    // Map field tags (gen:"json") to helpers like JSON{}
    FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
        "json": JSON{},
    },

    // Controls config scope; false applies config to whole package
    FileLevel: false,

    // Filter interfaces and structs to include or exclude during generation
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"}, // Only interfaces starting with "Query"
    ExcludeInterfaces: []any{"*Deprecated*"},
    IncludeStructs: []any{"User", "Account*"},
    ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
}
```


## Configuration Fields Explained

| Field Name          | Type         | Purpose                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OutPath`           | `string`     | Directory path to override the generated code output path for files in this package.                        |
| `FieldTypeMap`      | `map[any]any`| Maps Go native type instances (e.g., `sql.NullTime{}`) to wrapper field helpers (e.g., `field.Time{}`).      |
| `FieldNameMap`      | `map[string]any` | Maps field `gen` tag strings (e.g., `"json"`) to field helper types; prioritized over `FieldTypeMap`.   |
| `FileLevel`         | `bool`       | If true, config applies only to the file where declared; otherwise applies to whole package (default false).|
| `IncludeInterfaces` | `[]any`      | Optional whitelist pattern or type selectors for interface types to include in generation.                   |
| `ExcludeInterfaces` | `[]any`      | Optional blacklist pattern or type selectors for interface types to exclude. Applied after include filters. |
| `IncludeStructs`    | `[]any`      | Optional whitelist pattern or type selectors for struct types to include.                                  |
| `ExcludeStructs`    | `[]any`      | Optional blacklist pattern or type selectors for structs to exclude.                                      |


### Notes on Include/Exclude Filters

- **Whitelist Has Priority:** If `Include*` slices contain entries, only those matching types will be generated; `Exclude*` slices are ignored.
- **Supported Selectors:** String patterns with shell-style wildcards (e.g., `"Query*"`, `"*Repo"`) or typed literals like `models.User{}` or type conversions like `pkg.Query(nil)`.
- Filtering applies independently to interfaces and structs.

---

## Step-by-Step Customization Workflow

### Step 1: Create or Update Package-Level Config File

In a Go file within the package you want to customize, import required packages and declare a `genconfig.Config` variable.

```go
package examples

import (
    "database/sql"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",
    FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
        sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
    },
    FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
        "json": JSON{},
    },
    FileLevel: false,
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
    ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
}
```

> **Tip:** Name the file logically (e.g., `config.go`) and place it near your interface and model definitions for clarity.

---

### Step 2: Define Custom Field Helpers (Optional)

If you require custom helpers (like for JSON columns), define them in your project.

Example JSON field helper:

```go
package yourpackage

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"gorm.io/gorm/clause"
)

type JSON struct { column clause.Column }

func (j JSON) WithColumn(name string) JSON {
	c := j.column
	c.Name = name
	return JSON{column: c}
}

func (j JSON) Equal(path string, value any) clause.Expression {
	return jsonEqualExpr{col: j.column, path: path, val: value}
}

type jsonEqualExpr struct {
	col  clause.Column
	path string
	val  any
}

func (e jsonEqualExpr) Build(builder clause.Builder) {
	if stmt, ok := builder.(*gorm.Statement); ok {
		switch stmt.Dialector.Name() {
		case "mysql":
			v, _ := json.Marshal(e.val)
			clause.Expr{SQL: "JSON_EXTRACT(?, ?) = CAST(? AS JSON)", Vars: []any{e.col, e.path, string(v)}}.Build(builder)
		case "sqlite":
			clause.Expr{SQL: "json_valid(?) AND json_extract(?, ?) = ?", Vars: []any{e.col, e.col, e.path, e.val}}.Build(builder)
		default:
			clause.Expr{SQL: "jsonb_extract_path_text(?, ?) = ?", Vars: []any{e.col, e.path[2:], e.val}}.Build(builder)
		}
	}
}
```

---

### Step 3: Annotate Your Models With Tag for Custom Field Helpers

Use the `gen:"key"` struct tag matching your `FieldNameMap` to apply your custom field helpers.

```go
package models

type User struct {
    ID      int
    Profile string `gen:"json"` // Use JSON helper for this column
}
```

---

### Step 4: Apply Include and Exclude Filters to Scope Generation

Use `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, and `ExcludeStructs` in your config to control exactly which interfaces and structs the generator processes.

Filter examples:

- Include only interfaces starting with "Query":
  ```go
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  ```
- Exclude all structs ending with "DTO":
  ```go
  ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
  ```

---

### Step 5: Run Code Generation

Run the generator from the CLI, specifying input and optionally output directories.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./yourpackage -o ./generated
```

The generator applies your package-level config automatically.

---

## Understanding `FileLevel` Flag

- `FileLevel: false` (default): your config applies to the entire package/directory and its files.
- `FileLevel: true`: config applies only to the source file containing the config declaration.

Use `FileLevel: true` for precise overrides on a per-file basis in large packages.

---

## Best Practices

- **Centralize Config**: Keep your `genconfig.Config` declarations close to your interfaces and models to prevent confusion.
- **Prefer Include Over Exclude**: Use `Include*` filters to explicitly whitelist types for generation when possible.
- **Reuse Field Helpers**: Leverage existing `field` helpers from GORM CLI's field package (`field.Time`, `field.String`, etc.) where applicable.
- **Version Control Generated Code**: Consider committing generated code or adjusting your pipeline to suit your teamâ€™s workflow.

## Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Config Not Picked Up">
Ensure your `genconfig.Config` is declared at the package level (top level) and not inside functions or conditional blocks. The variable name should be a blank identifier (`var _ = genconfig.Config{...}`) so the generator can detect it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Field Mapping Not Applying">
Check your types and tags carefully. `FieldNameMap` entries take precedence over `FieldTypeMap`. Confirm your struct field contains the correct `gen:"tag"` string matching the keys.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Include/Exclude Patterns Not Filtering As Expected">
Patterns use shell-style wildcards. Ensure your pattern syntax is correct (e.g., "Query*" matches all starting with "Query"). When mixing typed literals and patterns, remember typed literals should be fully-qualified where needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output Directory Is Ignored">
If multiple configs with different `OutPath` are present in a nested directory structure, the generator applies the most specific config based on file path. Check your directory hierarchy.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Complete Package-Level Config

```go
package examples

import (
    "database/sql"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

// Package customization config
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",
    FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
        sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
    },
    FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
        "json": JSON{},
    },
    FileLevel: false,
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*", models.Query(nil)},
    ExcludeInterfaces: []any{"*Deprecated*"},
    IncludeStructs: []any{"User", "Account*", models.User{}},
    ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
}
```
