# Installation, Code Generation, and First Steps

This guide walks you through installing GORM CLI, generating type-safe APIs from your Go interfaces and models, and verifying the generated output. It is designed for first-time users aiming to see immediate results with practical examples of model and query interface inputs.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
This guide helps you install the GORM CLI tool, prepare a Go interface and model definitions with SQL templates, run the code generator to produce type-safe query APIs and field helpers, and verify the generated code works as expected.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or higher installed and configured
- Basic familiarity with Go modules
- A Go project set up with models and interfaces ready or sample code to try

### Expected Outcome
- GORM CLI installed and verified on your system
- Generated Go code containing safe query APIs from annotated interfaces and field helpers from your models
- A working example demonstrating querying and updating data using the generated code

### Time Estimate
10 - 20 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install GORM CLI
Install the GORM CLI tool globally using Go's install command.

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This adds the `gorm` CLI executable to your Go bin directory.

<Check>
Make sure your `GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory is in your system `PATH` so you can run `gorm` from any terminal.
</Check>

---

### Step 2: Prepare Your Models and Interfaces
Create or identify a Go package where your database models and query interfaces reside.

Your models should be properly structured Go structs, for example:

```go
// models/user.go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

Define your query interface with SQL templates in method comments:

```go
// query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

These interfaces influence the generated code.

<Info>
Place your models and interfaces in the same package or directory for GORM CLI to pick them both up.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Run the Generator
Use the `gorm gen` command to generate the code.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```
- `-i` or `--input`: Path to your Go package or file containing the raw SQL annotated interfaces.
- `-o` or `--output`: Directory where generated code will be saved (defaults to `./g` if omitted).

You should see console output like:

```bash
Generating file generated/query.gen.go from examples/query.go...
```

This means your query APIs and field helpers from models are generated successfully.

<Tip>
If you want more control over what is generated, you can define a `genconfig.Config` in your package. This allows inclusion/exclusion of interfaces, mapping custom field types, and output paths.
</Tip>

---

### Step 4: Use the Generated Code
After generation, you can use the APIs in your Go application:

```go
import (
  "context"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "generated"
  "models"
)

func example(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Retrieve user by ID
  user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Filter users by name and age
  result := generated.Query[models.User](db).FilterByNameAndAge("jinzhu", 25)
  // Use Find or Take methods on result as appropriate

  // Or directly query using field helpers
  users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
      Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
      Find(ctx)

  return nil
}
```

This usage ensures your queries are type-safe and expressive.

## 3. Real Example Input

### Query Interface Sample

```go
// examples/query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE @@column=@value
  FilterWithColumn(column string, value string) (T, error)
}
```

### Model Sample

```go
// models/user.go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

---

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Command not found after install:**
  - Ensure your Go bin directory is in your PATH.

- **No files generated:**
  - Validate the input path is correct and contains query interfaces or models.
  - Confirm that interfaces have proper SQL template comments.

- **Errors parsing SQL templates:**
  - Check the syntax of SQL comments on interface methods.
  - Refer to the Template DSL guides for correct directives.

- **Generated code not compiling:**
  - Check import paths and Go modules correctness.
  - Run `go mod tidy` if needed.

### Best Practices

- Keep interfaces and models well organized per package.
- Use the optional `genconfig.Config` to customize generation, especially for large projects.
- Use meaningful method names and accurate SQL templates for clarity.

### Performance Considerations

- The generator processes all Go files under the input path recursively.
- You can filter interfaces and models with include/exclude patterns in config to speed up the generator.

<Warning>
Avoid modifying generated files manually as they will be overwritten by future generator runs.
</Warning>

## Appendix: Command Reference

```bash
gorm gen --input <path-to-interfaces> --output <generated-code-directory>
```

- `--input` (`-i`): Required. Path to package or Go file with interfaces.
- `--output` (`-o`): Optional. Output directory for generated code. Defaults to `./g`.
