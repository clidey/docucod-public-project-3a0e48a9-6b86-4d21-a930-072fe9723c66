# Getting Started: Quickstart Guide

Welcome to your fast, step-by-step guide to getting started with **GORM CLI**. This guide will take you from installation through writing your first models and query interfaces, generating type-safe code, and performing basic CRUD operations. It's designed for users new to GORM CLI or those who want a straightforward end-to-end working example.

---

## 1. Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
- Install the GORM CLI tool
- Define Go structs as database models
- Create query interfaces with SQL templates
- Generate type-safe query APIs and field helpers automatically
- Run simple queries and updates using the generated code

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or higher installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Go modules and Go structs
- Familiarity with GORM basics is helpful but not required

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional setup where you:
- Write and run queries using type-safe APIs generated from your interface definitions
- Use model-driven field helpers to build query conditions and updates
- Perform association operations on related models

### Time Estimate
20 to 40 minutes depending on prior Go experience

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 2. Installation

The first step is to install the GORM CLI tool, which is a Go command-line application.

### Steps

1. **Install GORM CLI via Go:**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

2. **Verify Installation:**

Run:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

You should see usage information and available flags.

<Tip>
Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` to run `gorm` directly from the shell.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Define Your Models and Query Interfaces

The core power of GORM CLI comes from writing Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates and model structs annotated for your database.

### Example Models

Create a Go file for your models, e.g. `models/user.go`:

```go
package models

import (
  "time"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name      string
  Age       int
  Email     string
  Status    string
  CreatedAt time.Time
}
```

### Example Query Interface

Create an interface with SQL template comments, e.g. `query.go`:

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE name=@name AND age=@age
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

These annotations instruct the generator to create safe, idiomatic query methods.

<Tip>
Use `@@table` to refer to the table name of the model, and `@param` to bind Go method parameters.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Generate the Code

Use the CLI command `gorm gen` to convert the interfaces and models into generated code.

### Basic Command Example

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```
- `-i` is the input directory or file containing your interface and model definitions.
- `-o` is the output directory for generated Go code.

### What Happens
- The tool reads your interfaces and Go model structs.
- Generates type-safe query methods for interfaces.
- Generates field helpers for model fields.

<Check>
Ensure your Go code builds cleanly before running generation to avoid errors.
</Check>

---

## 5. Using Generated APIs

After generation, you integrate generated code into your application by importing the generated package.

### Querying by ID Example

```go
import (
  "context"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "generated" // the output package
  "examples/models"
)

func example(db *gorm.DB) {
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Query user by id = 123
  user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
  if err != nil {
    // handle error
    return
  }
  fmt.Println(user)
}
```

### Building Queries With Field Helpers

The generator creates typed field helpers for fields:

```go
users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
```

### Performing Updates

```go
err := generated.Query[models.User](db).
  UpdateUser(ctx, models.User{Name: "jinzhu", Age: 20}, 1)
if err != nil {
  // handle error
}
```

### Managing Associations

You can use generated association helpers for related models (see advanced guides for details).

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Organize your code**: Define interfaces and models in well-structured package directories.
- **Use SQL templating thoughtfully**: Utilize directives like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, and parameter binding for flexible queries.
- **Leverage generated field helpers**: Use them to avoid writing raw SQL strings and gain compile-time checks.
- **Configure generation**: Use package-level `genconfig.Config` for custom output paths, type mappings, and inclusion/exclusion rules.

<Tip>
For beginner users, start simple with a few query interfaces and models before expanding.
</Tip>

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No output generated**: Confirm input interface files contain the proper `// SQL` annotations and package-level config does not exclude them.
- **Compilation errors after generation**: Check model struct tags and SQL syntax in interface comments.
- **Run-time errors querying**: Ensure database connection is properly initialized and context is passed if required.

<Warning>
The tool requires Go 1.18+ due to generics usage. Upgrade your Go toolchain if generation or usage fails due to generics.
</Warning>
