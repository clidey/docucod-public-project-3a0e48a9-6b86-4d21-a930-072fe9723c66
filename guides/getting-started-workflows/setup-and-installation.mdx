# Setup and CLI Installation

This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool, verifying the installation, and configuring your environment to generate code seamlessly. By following these steps, you'll prepare your system to run GORM CLI and perform your first successful code generation.

---

## 1. Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Install the GORM CLI tool on your system
- Verify that the CLI is correctly installed and accessible
- Set up your environment so you can generate type-safe GORM query code

### Prerequisites
- Go programming language installed, version **1.18 or higher**
- Git installed and available in your system PATH
- Supported operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will have the GORM CLI installed and configured, with basic validation confirming you can run the tool successfully on your machine.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-15 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

---

## 2. Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify System Prerequisites
Before installing GORM CLI, confirm your environment meets basic requirements.

1. Check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

- The output must show Go 1.18 or newer (e.g., `go version go1.20 linux/amd64`).

2. Confirm Git is installed:

```bash
git --version
```

- Ensure git is installed and returns a version number.

3. Confirm Go's binary directory is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

- The output should include the path to Go binaries, typically `$HOME/go/bin`

<Tip>
If Go or Git commands fail, install or update them before proceeding. Go can be installed from https://golang.org/dl/. Git is available at https://git-scm.com/downloads.
</Tip>

---

### Step 2: Install the GORM CLI Tool
Use the official Go install command to fetch and build the CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This downloads and installs the latest version of GORM CLI to your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

---

### Step 3: Verify CLI Installation
1. Ensure the binary directory is in your system PATH.

```bash
which gorm
```

- It should output the full path to the `gorm` executable.

2. Run the CLI help command to confirm it works:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- You should see usage information and available commands, including `gen` (generate code).

<Tip>
If the `gorm` command is not found, add your Go bin directory to your PATH:

For Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
setx PATH "$env:USERPROFILE\go\bin;$env:PATH"
```

Then restart your terminal.
</Tip>

---

### Step 4: Prepare For Your First Code Generation
1. Create or identify a Go source file containing your model definitions and interfaces with SQL annotations.

2. Use the `gorm gen` command to generate the type-safe query APIs:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces.go -o ./generated
```

- The `-i` flag specifies the input file or directory.
- The `-o` flag specifies the output directory for generated code.

---

### Step 5: Confirm Successful Code Generation
1. Check the specified output directory for generated Go files.
2. Review and integrate generated code into your project by importing and using the generated query interfaces and helpers.

<Check>
If code is generated without errors, your installation and environment are correctly configured.
</Check>

---

## 3. Practical Example

Suppose you have an interface file `examples/query.go` with query interfaces and models in the `examples` package.

Run the following to generate code:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./examples/generated
```

Expected output shows generated files, e.g.: 

```
Generating file ./examples/generated/query_gen.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

Your project now contains type-safe query APIs you can use directly.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI Command Not Found">

- **Cause:** Go binary directory not in system PATH.
- **Solution:** Add Go bin (`$HOME/go/bin`) to PATH as shown in Step 3.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Missing">

- **Cause:** Using Go below version 1.18 or Go not installed.
- **Solution:** Install or upgrade Go to version 1.18 or later.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors During Installation">

- **Cause:** Insufficient filesystem permissions or conflicting installs.
- **Solution:** Run the install command with appropriate permissions or fix Go environment.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generation Errors Due to Missing Interfaces or Files">

- **Cause:** Incorrect `-i` path or missing query interfaces.
- **Solution:** Verify input path is correct and interfaces contain proper SQL annotations.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always keep your Go environment updated and ensure your project compiles and runs normally before running the GORM CLI code generator.
