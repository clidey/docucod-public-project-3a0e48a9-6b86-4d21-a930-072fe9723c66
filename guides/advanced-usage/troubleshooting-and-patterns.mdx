# Troubleshooting and Best Practices

## Overview

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common issues encountered when using GORM CLI, especially during setup, code generation, and integration phases. It also provides best practices and organizational patterns to maximize maintainability and code quality in projects using GORM CLI.

Whether you’re a beginner or integrating GORM CLI into a larger Go application, this page equips you with actionable solutions and recommendations to ensure a smooth developer experience.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. CLI Command Not Found
**Symptom:** Running `gorm gen` or `gorm` commands results in "command not found".

**Causes & Solutions:**
- GORM CLI is not installed or not in your system PATH.
- Ensure Go (version 1.18+) is installed and your `$GOPATH/bin` or equivalent directory is in your PATH.
- Install using:
  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```
- Validate installation with:
  ```bash
  gorm --help
  ```

<Check>
Always verify Go version with `go version` to confirm compatibility.
</Check>

### 2. Input File Missing or Incorrect
**Symptom:** The generator errors with messages indicating it cannot read interface files or no methods found.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- The `-i` (`--input`) flag path is incorrect or points to an empty/non-Go file.
- Double-check the interface file path and confirm it contains interface definitions with SQL comments.
- Use absolute or relative paths carefully to point to the correct directory or file.

### 3. No Output or Empty Generated Files
**Symptom:** The generation command completes without error but produces no files or files without the expected content.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Ensure your query interfaces and model structs are correctly declared and exported.
- Check for `genconfig.Config` filtering settings that may exclude interfaces or structs unintentionally.
- Remove or adjust `Include*` and `Exclude*` filters in your configuration.
- Confirm your SQL template comments are properly formatted and associated with interface methods.

### 4. Method Signature or Return Value Errors
**Symptom:** Generator panics or fails when processing interface methods.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Check that interface methods return the correct number of results: either a single error or a pair `(T, error)`.
- Ensure the last returned type is always `error` when present.
- For "finish methods" with raw SQL, returning at least one value is mandatory (usually data + error).

<Tip>
Design your interface methods carefully following the rules defined in the [Writing Models & Query Interfaces](../getting-started/first-code-gen/writing-models-interfaces) guide.
</Tip>

### 5. SQL Template Parsing Failures
**Symptom:** Errors about malformed SQL templates or unsupported directives.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Check SQL template comments for correct usage of GORM CLI’s SQL Template DSL directives such as `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}} ... {{end}}`, and `{{for}}`.
- Avoid syntax errors in these blocks.
- Escape any literal '@' characters (`\@`) to prevent misinterpretation.
- Refer to the [Template DSL Guide](../guides/advanced-usage/template-dsl-guide) for full syntax and examples.

### 6. Generated Code Does Not Compile
**Symptom:** Compilation errors when importing or using generated code.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Ensure that the output directory is correctly imported as a package in your project.
- Verify that dependencies like `gorm.io/gorm` and `gorm.io/cli/gorm/field` are correctly installed.
- Use formatted imports by running `go mod tidy` after generation.
- Confirm Go generics support: Go 1.18+ is mandatory.

### 7. Association Helpers Misbehavior
**Symptom:** Association operations like Create, Unlink, or Delete do not work as expected.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Verify your model struct tags and associations are correctly defined following GORM’s conventions.
- Use the latest version of the generator to benefit from association helper generation.
- Understand association semantics per [Advanced Associations Guide](../guides/advanced-usage/advanced-associations).

## Best Practices for Using GORM CLI

### Organize Your Project Structure Thoughtfully
- Place query interfaces and model structs close together (same package or directory) for easier generation.
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions for interfaces (e.g., `Query[T any]`) and models.
- Keep related models and interfaces modular to avoid overloading a single package.

### Leverage Configuration (`genconfig.Config`)
- Use the package-level `genconfig.Config` to override default output paths, include/exclude filters, and field helper mappings.
- Avoid generating code for deprecated or irrelevant interfaces by configuring `ExcludeInterfaces`.
- Apply `FieldNameMap` and `FieldTypeMap` to customize field helpers (e.g., for JSON, time, or custom types).

### SQL Template DSL Usage
- Write clean, readable SQL templates using the DSL rather than inline raw SQL.
- Take advantage of `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` blocks for dynamic query and update construction.
- Use placeholders such as `@@table`, `@@column`, and `@param` to keep SQL safe and maintainable.

### Test Generated Code Early and Often
- After code generation, build and run simple queries to confirm API validity.
- Use the [Validating Your First Code Generation](../getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/quick-validation) guide as a checklist.

### Version Control Generated Code Thoughtfully
- Commit generated code to version control if your project requires stable API types.
- Alternatively, integrate generation as part of your build process or CI pipeline.

### Keep Dependencies Up to Date
- Regularly update GORM CLI and `gorm.io/gorm` to incorporate bug fixes and feature improvements.

## Tips for Integrating Into Larger Projects

- Use the `-o` output path flag to generate code into a dedicated folder within your project, keeping generated code separate.
- Avoid modifying generated files manually; instead, update interfaces and regenerate.
- Document your generation workflow and config settings in your project’s README for team clarity.
- Automate generation via scripts or Makefiles to reduce human error.

## Summary
Keep your interfaces, models, and generation configuration consistent and validated. Use the GORM CLI SQL template DSL to write expressive, safe SQL queries. Maintain clear separation of generated code and your handwritten code, ensuring smooth integration and iterating by fixing generation and signature errors per the guidance. Regularly test generated code early and commit when stable or automate its generation.

<Tip>
For any persistent or unclear issues, consult the official GORM CLI GitHub repository issues page or open a new ticket with your code sample and error details.
