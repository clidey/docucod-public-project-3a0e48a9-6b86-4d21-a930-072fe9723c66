# Field Helpers and Association Semantics

This document unpacks the core logic behind the generated **field helpers** and **association operators** in GORM CLI. It explains how the system constructs **predicates** (filters), **setters** (updates/creates), and **relationship helpers** to make database operations not only fluent but **type-safe** at compile time. Users will learn how these constructs facilitate common operations such as filtering, updating, and manipulating associations with confidence and precision.

---

## Understanding Field Helpers

GORM CLI generates **field helpers** from your Go model structs, transforming each field into a strongly-typed construct that enables expressive and compile-checked query and update statements. These helpers align with your database columns, encapsulating SQL predicate and assignment logic.

### Types of Field Helpers

- **Basic fields** correspond to scalar types like `int`, `string`, `bool`, `time.Time`, nullable types and custom types mapped through configuration.
- **Association fields** represent relationships and use two specialized flavors:
  - `field.Struct[T]` for single (one-to-one or belongs-to) associations.
  - `field.Slice[T]` for multi-record collections (one-to-many or many-to-many).

### Predicates (Filtering)

Every field helper provides methods to build SQL conditions safely. For example:

```go
// Predicate example: generate WHERE conditions
generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")      // WHERE name = 'alice'
generated.User.Age.Gt(18)              // WHERE age > 18
generated.User.Score.IsNull()          // WHERE score IS NULL
```

These predicates are type-safe and prevent common errors like mismatched types or invalid column names.

### Setters (Updates and Creates)

Field helpers also define setters for building updates or insertions through `Set(...)`. For example:

```go
// Setters example: generate SET assignments
generated.User.Name.Set("bob")       // SET name = 'bob'
generated.User.Age.Incr(1)             // SET age = age + 1
```

Combined with GORM's `Set(...).Update(ctx)` or `Set(...).Create(ctx)`, these helpers allow elegant and safe data modifications.

### Handling Zero and Null Values

The generated setters correctly support zero values (e.g., empty strings, false booleans) and nullable types (e.g., `sql.NullInt64`) to express `NULL` assignments seamlessly.

---

## Association Helpers and Operators

Associations represent relationships between models and require specialized helpers that can act on related rows safely and efficiently. GORM CLI generates **association helpers** as:

- `field.Struct[T]` — for associations involving exactly one related record (e.g., has one, belongs to).
- `field.Slice[T]` — for associations representing collections (e.g., has many, many-to-many).

### Core Operations

Association helpers provide the following key operation builders, which are designed to be passed into `Set(...).Update(ctx)` or `Set(...).Create(ctx)` calls:

| Operation   | Description                                                    | Use Case Example                                       |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Create`    | Create a new associated record per matched parent             | Creating a pet when creating a user                     |
| `CreateInBatch` | Batch create multiple associated records per matched parent | Batch linking languages when updating a user            |
| `Update`    | Update associated records matching optional conditions        | Updating pet names with a condition                      |
| `Unlink`    | Remove association link without deleting associated records   | Clearing user’s pets association without deleting pets  |
| `Delete`    | Delete associated records (or join rows for m2m)              | Removing pets or join rows permanently                    |

### Condition Filtering on Associations

For multi-record associations (and single ones to some extent), you can apply `Where(...)` conditions to target specific associated rows before `Update`, `Unlink`, or `Delete` operations:

```go
generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("fido")).Update(
    generated.Pet.Name.Set("rex"),
)
```

This targets the user's associated pets named "fido" to update their names.

### Unlink Semantics by Association Type

- **belongs to:** sets the parent foreign key (FK) to NULL without deleting
- **has one/has many:** sets the child FK to NULL
- **many2many:** removes entries from join tables only

Unlink clears links but preserves associated records.

### Delete Semantics by Association Type

- Deletes associated rows or join records (for many2many). The records themselves in base tables are deleted only if applicable.

### Examples

Create + associate a new record:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

Batch create many-to-many relations:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(
    generated.User.Languages.CreateInBatch([]models.Language{{Code: "EN"}, {Code: "FR"}}),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

Delete associated records conditionally:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(
    generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("old")).Delete(),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

Unlink all pets:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Unlink()).
  Update(ctx)
```

## Compile-Time Safety

The generated field and association helpers encode database columns and relationships as typed Go constructs. This design enforces compile-time constraints on:

- Field names and associated tables
- Predicate argument types
- Assignment types in update/create operations
- Valid chaining of queries and operations on associations

This eliminates a broad category of runtime errors caused by invalid field or association references, thus improving code reliability.

---

## Internal Representation of Association Helpers (Conceptual)

Under the hood, association helpers track:

- The **association name** (corresponding to the relationship field in the model)
- Optional **conditions** that filter the associated records

```go
// Simplified associationWithConditions example
associationWithConditions {
  name string             // e.g., "Pets"
  conditions []clause.Expression // e.g., generated.Pet.Name.Eq("fido")
}
```

Operations (`Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Unlink`, `CreateInBatch`) produce `clause.Association` structs encapsulating SQL update semantics, used by GORM internally when performing actual DB operations.

This design allows fluent composition and clear semantics of complex association interactions with parent records.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use association helpers for all create/update/delete of related models** to ensure foreign keys and join tables are managed safely.
- **Apply `Where(...)` filters on association helpers** when operations should only affect specific related records.
- **Understand unlink semantics** to avoid unintended deletes — unlinking removes association links only.
- **For bulk operations, prefer `CreateInBatch`** to reduce the number of database calls.
- **Check generated code** to understand how your model fields are represented with typed helpers.
- **Use the helpers in your queries and mutations for maximum type safety and discoverability.**

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Association Operations">
<Accordion title="No associated record created when using Create helper">
Check that the association helper is used with `Set(...).Create(ctx)` or `Update(ctx)` on the parent record. Association helpers generate the necessary clauses only when combined with these calls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Update on association affects unintended records">
Ensure you apply the `Where(...)` method on the association helper to filter target rows precisely before calling `Update(...)`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unlinking does not set FK to NULL as expected">
Verify your association type; unlink semantics depend on the relationship type: has one/many sets child FK to NULL; belongs to sets parent FK to NULL; many2many deletes join rows.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Batch create fails or does not link properly">
`CreateInBatch` requires passing slices of model instances; ensure slices are correctly constructed and associated in the context of the parent.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
