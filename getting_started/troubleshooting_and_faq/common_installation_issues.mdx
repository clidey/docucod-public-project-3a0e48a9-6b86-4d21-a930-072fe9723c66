# Solving Installation Issues

This page addresses frequent installation and environment problems encountered when setting up the GORM CLI tool. Each issue is paired with clear, actionable solutions designed to unblock your setup quickly so you can focus on generating your first code.

---

## 1. Common Installation Problems & Fixes

### Problem: Go Version Mismatch

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** due to its use of generics.

#### How to Check Your Go Version

Run:
```bash
go version
```
Expected output example for a supported version:
```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your version is older:
- Upgrade your Go installation by downloading a newer release from the official website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
- For Linux/macOS, you can use package managers such as `brew` or `apt`.

<Warning>
Using a Go version below 1.18 will cause the CLI installation and generated code compilation to fail.
</Warning>

---

### Problem: Missing Dependencies (Git, Go Toolchain)

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure these dependencies are correctly installed and accessible in your system PATH:

- **Go toolchain** (version 1.18+)
- **Git** (required for some module dependencies)

#### Verify Dependencies

```bash
go version
git --version
```

#### Troubleshooting

- If `git` command is not found, install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and ensure it is added to your PATH.
- If `go` command is not found, reinstall Go and configure your shell profile to include Go’s binary directory.

---

### Problem: Go Bin Directory Not in PATH

After installing Go, your system must include `$GOPATH/bin` (or Go’s bin directory) in the PATH environment variable to run `gorm` CLI directly.

#### How to Verify

```bash
echo $PATH
```
Check if the Go bin directory is included, e.g., `/home/user/go/bin` or `/usr/local/go/bin`.

#### How to Add to PATH

- **Linux/macOS:** Add the following line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```
- **Windows (Command Prompt):**
  ```cmd
  setx PATH "%PATH%;%GOPATH%\bin"
  ```
- Restart your terminal session after updating PATH.


---

### Problem: Permission Denied When Installing CLI

You may encounter permission errors while running the `go install` command.

#### Solution

- Use your user-level Go environment without `sudo`. Example:
  ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```
- Ensure your Go bin directory is writable by your user.
- Avoid installing Go packages globally as root to prevent permission issues.

<Info>
Running Go tools under your user account is the recommended approach.

### Problem: Windows PowerShell Execution Restrictions

If you see errors about script execution policies when running CLI commands on Windows PowerShell:

#### Solution

- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
- Restart PowerShell.

---

### Problem: Networking or Firewall Issues Blocking Dependency Downloads

Some installs may fail due to firewall restrictions preventing module downloads or Git access.

#### Solution

- Ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) is open for your system.
- Verify GitHub and Go module proxy URLs are accessible:
  - `https://github.com`
  - `https://proxy.golang.org`
- If behind a corporate proxy, configure environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` properly.

Reference your IT support if access restrictions persist.

## 2. Troubleshooting Installation Errors

When errors occur, identifying the exact cause helps unblock setup swiftly.

### Diagnosing Installation Failures

- Check error message details; search for keywords like "version", "permission", or "path".
- Confirm environment variables like `GOPATH` and `PATH`.
- Run `go env` and check settings.
- Confirm your project and CLI commands target the correct Go version and directory.

### Validating CLI Installation

After installation, validate with:
```bash
gorm version
```
Expected output is the version number of the installed CLI.

<Check>
If this command fails or is not found, revisit PATH configuration.
</Check>


## 3. Additional Best Practices

- Always use the latest stable Go release (1.18+).
- Keep your system dependencies like Git current.
- Regularly update GORM CLI:
  ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```
- Run CLI commands from your project root or from directories containing your Go models and query interfaces.
