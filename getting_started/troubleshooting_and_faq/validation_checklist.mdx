# Quick Setup Validation

Welcome to the Quick Setup Validation guide for **GORM CLI**. This concise checklist helps you confirm that your environment and generated code are working as expected, so you can move forward with confidence and start building with your type-safe queries and model-driven helpers.

---

## 1. Validate Your Environment

Before verifying generated code, ensure your setup meets the minimum requirements:

- Go version 1.18 or higher installed and accessible
- GORM CLI installed (`gorm` command available)
- Your Go workspace properly configured with necessary dependencies

You can quickly verify your `gorm` CLI tool installation by running:

```bash
gorm version
```

This should print the installed version without errors.

<Tip>
If the `gorm` command is not found, ensure your Go bin directory is in your system `PATH` environment variable.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Confirm Generated Code Files

After running the code generation command:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path_to_interfaces -o ./generated
```

Check the output directory (`./generated` in this example) for:

- Generated Go files containing query interfaces and implementations
- Model-driven field helper declarations

You should see files mirroring your input package structure with generated types and functions.

<Check>
Generated files present and match your input interfaces and model structs
</Check>

---

## 3. Compile and Import Generated Code

Integrate the generated code into your Go project:

1. Import the generated package where you want to run queries.
2. Ensure your project compiles without errors.

For example:

```go
import "yourmodule/generated"

// Use database connection db *gorm.DB
```

Compile your project:

```bash
go build ./...
```

<Warning>
Compilation failures often indicate missing or misconfigured imports, or mismatches between your model definitions and generated code.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Run Sample Commands to Verify APIs

Use the generated APIs with a test database connection to confirm the code functions:

### Example: Query by ID

```go
ctx := context.Background()
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Query failed: %v", err)
}
fmt.Printf("User: %+v\n", user)
```

### Example: Using Field Helpers in Conditions

```go
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Find failed: %v", err)
}
fmt.Printf("Adult users: %d\n", len(users))
```

---

## 5. Interpret Your Results

- A successful query returns expected data structs without errors.
- Errors may indicate database connection issues, mismatches in table or column names, or runtime query generation bugs.

<Tip>
Enable detailed logging in GORM to view generated SQL and diagnose issues:

```go
db, _ := gorm.Open(..., &gorm.Config{ Logger: logger.Default.LogMode(logger.Info) })
```
</Tip>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Generated Code Not Found or Empty">
Ensure your input paths to interfaces are correct and that interfaces have proper SQL template comments. Re-run the generation with verbose output if available.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compile Errors Related to Missing Imports">
Check that your `go.mod` file includes dependencies like `gorm.io/gorm` and that package paths match your import statements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Query Errors or Empty Results">
Verify your database connection is correct and your test data is seeded. Confirm table and column names align with your model definitions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Command Not Found: gorm">
Make sure you installed the CLI using `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` and your Go bin directory is in your PATH.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

- Proceed to write your own SQL-templated interfaces and models to expand your API surface.
- Explore advanced configuration options in the genconfig.Config to customize generation.
- Refer to the [Your First Code Generation](../first_code_generation/generating_code) guide for detailed workflow.
- For troubleshooting setup issues, see [Solving Installation Issues](../troubleshooting_and_faq/common_installation_issues).

## Summary Checklist

| Step                          | Confirmation                              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Environment Validation         | `gorm version` runs without errors       |
| Generated Files Present        | Output directory contains generated code |
| Code Compiles                  | No build errors using generated code     |
| Sample Queries Execute         | Queries return expected data              |
| Troubleshooting Common Issues  | Refer troubleshooting accordions above   |
