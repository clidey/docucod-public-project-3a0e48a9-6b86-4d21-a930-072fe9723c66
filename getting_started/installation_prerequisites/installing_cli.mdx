# Installing the GORM CLI

This guide provides a straightforward, step-by-step process for installing the GORM CLI tool on your development environment. We cover installation using Go modules, platform-specific notes, and tips to ensure a smooth setup so you can start generating type-safe GORM query APIs quickly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you install the GORM CLI, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Go toolchain:** Go version 1.18 or later is mandatory as GORM CLI uses generics.
- **Operating Systems supported:** Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Dependencies:** You need Git installed and accessible via `PATH`, as it is used for downloading the CLI module.
- **Network access:** Your development environment must have internet connectivity to fetch the Go modules from public repositories.


<Tip>
Verify your Go installation with:

```bash
go version
```
Ensure it shows 1.18 or higher.

Check Git by running:

```bash
git --version
```
</Tip>


## 2. Installation Instructions

The GORM CLI is installed as a Go module binary, leveraging the Go modules system for simple and reproducible installation.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to install the latest version of the GORM CLI globally:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

3. Ensure that your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to call `gorm` from any location.

4. Confirm the installation by checking the version:

```bash
gorm version
```
You should see CLI version details printed.


<Warning>
If `gorm` command is not found, verify that your Go binaries directory is in your `PATH`. Common locations include:
- Linux/macOS: `$HOME/go/bin`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`
</Warning>

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows:** Use PowerShell or Command Prompt with elevated permissions if needed. Update your environment variables to include Go's bin directory.
- **macOS & Linux:** It's recommended to add `export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"` to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).


## 3. Verifying the Installation

To confirm GORM CLI is correctly installed and ready for use:

- Run:

```bash
gorm help
```

You should see the CLI usage instructions and available commands.

- Running the generator command without parameters should prompt you with usage and required flags:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

- Try generating code from a sample interface (see 'Your First Code Generation' docs for sample interfaces).


## 4. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="'gorm' command not found">
Verify you added your Go bin directory to the `PATH`. Restart your terminal after updating environment variables.

Example for Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

For Windows, update Environment Variables via System Settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version too low or missing">
Make sure Go 1.18+ is installed:

```bash
go version
```

If not, download and install from the official Go website:
https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or proxy errors during installation">
Check your network connection. If you use a Go proxy, ensure your `GOPROXY` environment variable is configured properly:

```bash
go env GOPROXY
```

Set to default:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If you need to install a specific version instead of the latest, replace `latest` with the desired semantic version (e.g., `v0.2.1`):

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v0.2.1
```
</Tip>

## 5. Next Steps

After installation, you are ready to:

- Write your first query interface and models (see "Your First Code Generation: Minimal Configuration")
- Generate type-safe code using the `gorm gen` command
- Explore the rich type-safe API and model-driven field helpers to build robust GORM queries

## Summary

- Install GORM CLI via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` on supported platforms
- Ensure Go toolchain version 1.18+ and Git are properly set up
- Verify the installation with `gorm version` and `gorm help`
- Common issues involve `PATH` configuration and Go version mismatches
- Next steps: write query interfaces, run `gorm gen`, and explore generated APIs
