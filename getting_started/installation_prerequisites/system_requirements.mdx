# System Requirements for GORM CLI

This page outlines the minimum supported Go version, required dependencies, and supported operating systems to run GORM CLI effectively. Ensuring your environment meets these requirements is critical before installing and using GORM CLI for generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers.

---

## 1. Go Version Compatibility

GORM CLI relies on Go generics and cutting-edge language features introduced in recent releases.

- **Minimum Go version:** 1.18

  This version introduced generics support, which GORM CLI depends on for strongly typed code generation.

- **Recommended Go version:** Latest stable (Go 1.19 or later)

  Using the latest Go version ensures optimal performance, bug fixes, and compatibility.

### Verifying Your Go Version

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ go version
```

Expected output:

```bash
go version go1.18.0 linux/amd64
```

If your version is older than 1.18, upgrade your Go installation.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is compatible with the main platforms Go supports:

- **Linux** (amd64, arm64)
- **macOS / Darwin** (amd64, arm64)
- **Windows** (amd64)

Use native or container environments on these OSes to run the CLI smoothly.

---

## 3. Required Dependencies

To install and run GORM CLI, you must have:

- **Go Toolchain (1.18+)**
  - Includes `go` command, module support, and compiler

- **GORM ORM library (optional for your project)**
  - GORM CLI generates helper code designed to integrate seamlessly with `gorm.io/gorm`.
  - You do not need to install this specifically for the CLI, but your generated code depends on it.

- **Git**
  - Required for downloading the CLI package via Go modules

- **Database drivers and environment (at runtime)**
  - While not directly required to run the CLI, your application using generated code should have proper database drivers installed corresponding to your database (e.g., MySQL, Postgres).

---

## 4. Network and Environment Considerations

- **Internet Access**
  - Needed to download GORM CLI and dependencies via `go install` or `go get`.

- **Firewall and Proxy Settings**
  - Ensure your network allows outbound connections to `proxy.golang.org` and GitHub repositories.

- **Disk Space**
  - Minimal for the CLI tool itself (tens of megabytes).
  - Additional space will depend on your project and generated code.

---

## 5. Verification Checklist Before Proceeding

<Check>
- Confirm your Go version is 1.18 or higher
- Ensure `go` and `git` commands are available in your terminal
- Use a supported OS among Linux, macOS, or Windows
- Validate network access for module downloads
</Check>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Requirements">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
If you run: `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` and see errors about generics or unsupported syntax, your Go toolchain version is likely below 1.18.

**Solution:** Upgrade Go by downloading the latest version from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Operating System or Architecture">
GORM CLI binaries are built for mainstream architectures. Running on ARM or uncommon platforms may require building from source.

**Solution:** Either switch to a supported platform or build CLI from source:

```bash
go build -o gorm-cli ./cmd/gorm
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues Downloading Dependencies">
If module downloads fail:
- Check your internet connectivity
- Configure proxies for Go modules by setting `GOPROXY`

Example:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Git Command">
The Go module system requires `git` to fetch repository code.

**Solution:** Install Git and ensure it is in your PATH.
