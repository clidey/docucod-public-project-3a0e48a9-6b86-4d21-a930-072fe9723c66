# Troubleshooting Common Issues

When working with GORM CLI, you may encounter setup or code generation errors that can interrupt your workflow or lead to unexpected results. This guide addresses the most frequent problems related to missing modules, interface-model mismatches, and configuration issues. Follow the practical solutions, tips for diagnosing errors, and guidance on where to look for detailed logs to get back on track quickly.

---

## 1. Common Setup and Environment Issues

### 1.1 Missing or Incompatible Go Modules

**Problem:** The generator fails with errors indicating missing Go modules or unsupported Go versions.

**Solution:**

- Ensure you have Go 1.18 or later installed. GORM CLI requires Go modules and generics support available from Go 1.18.
- Run `go mod tidy` in your project directory to resolve and download all dependencies.
- Verify your `GOPATH` and `PATH` environment variables include your Go binary and modules paths.

```bash
# Check Go version
go version

# Tidy up dependencies
cd your-project-directory

go mod tidy
```

<Check>
Ensure that your Go environment is correctly set up and that you can build your project manually.
</Check>

### 1.2 PATH Misconfiguration

**Problem:** After installation via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`, the CLI command `gorm` is not recognized.

**Solution:**
- Confirm that `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your system PATH.

```bash
# Add to PATH (bash example)
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
# Or add to your shell profile ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
```

- Restart your terminal or reload the shell profile after updating PATH.

## 2. Interface and Model Mismatches

### 2.1 Interface Method Signatures Missing or Incorrect

**Symptom:** Generator panics or errors arise indicating that interface methods have invalid return types or missing returns.

**Cause:** According to GORM CLI rules:

- Methods with SQL templates ("finish methods") must return at least one value, with the last being `error`.
- Methods can return either `(T, error)` or just `error`.
- Methods with multiple return values cannot exceed two (e.g., data + error).

**How to Fix:**

- Review method signatures in your query interfaces.
- Ensure the last return type is always `error`.
- If returning one value, it must be `error`.

Example:

```go
// Correct signature for finish method
GetByID(id int) (T, error)

// Incorrect - missing error
GetByID(id int) T
```

### 2.2 Mismatched Interface and Model Types

**Symptom:** Generated code does not compile due to type incompatibilities.

**Cause:** Your interfaces or SQL templates may reference types not matching your model struct definitions or include unresolved generic parameters.

**How to Fix:**

- Keep your interfaces and model definitions in sync.
- Verify that the generic type `T` in interfaces corresponds to your actual model struct.
- Avoid ambiguous or complex generic usage that the generator cannot resolve.

<Info>
Tip: Place your interfaces and models within the same package or directory to simplify relative package path resolution.

## 3. Generation Configuration and File Path Issues

### 3.1 Generator Output Path Misconfiguration

**Symptom:** Generated files land in unexpected directories or overwrite important code.

**Cause:** Your package-level `genconfig.Config` might specify an `OutPath` inconsistent with your project structure.

**How to Fix:**

- Review and adjust the `OutPath` in your configuration files.

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "./generated",  // set this relative to your project root
}
```

- If you use multiple nested configs, ensure you understand file-level (`FileLevel`) vs package-level config resolution. Child configs override ancestor configs when `FileLevel = true`.

### 3.2 Interfaces or Structs Not Getting Generated

**Symptom:** Some interfaces or models are omitted from code generation.

**Cause:** Include/Exclude filters in `genconfig.Config` may restrict generation unexpectedly.

**How to Fix:**

- Check `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, and `ExcludeStructs` patterns.
- Remember whitelist (`Include*`) takes precedence over blacklist (`Exclude*`).
- Patterns support shell-style globbing; ensure correct patterns for your target types.

Example:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"}, // only generate interfaces with prefix Query
    ExcludeInterfaces: []any{"*Deprecated*"},
}
```

### 3.3 Configuration Ignored or Not Detected

**Symptom:** Changes in config have no effect; code generated fails to reflect new settings.

**Cause:** Config declarations must be package-level and correctly formed.

**How to Fix:**

- Verify your `genconfig.Config` is declared as a package-level variable with proper composite literal syntax.
- The generator automatically picks up config declared in the target package directory.

Example:

```go
package mypkg

import "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "myoutput",
}
```

## 4. Diagnosing Errors Using Logs and Output

### 4.1 Understanding Generator Console Output

- During `gorm gen` execution, watch for messages like:

  ```
  Generating file myoutput/models_user.go from examples/models/user.go...
  Skipping generated file: myoutput/models_user.go
  ```

  They can indicate skipped files or successful generation.

- Read error messages carefully to locate problematic files or methods.

### 4.2 Investigating Parsing or Template Rendering Failures

- If the generator fails parsing your commented SQL template, examine the method comments matching the errors.
- Use the included unit test patterns (`internal/gen/sqlparser_test.go`) to validate your SQL templates locally.

### 4.3 Viewing Generated Files

- Explore your `OutPath` directory for generated `.go` files.
- Inspect generated code to confirm your interfaces and models are represented as expected.

<Note>
Malformed or incomplete templates in interface comments can cause silent or confusing errors â€“ always validate templates incrementally.
</Note>

## 5. Best Practices for Smooth Setup

- Keep your model structs and interfaces well-aligned in a single package to minimize path issues.
- Use explicit package imports and avoid ambiguous naming.
- Start with minimal configurations and add filters only once confirmed working.
- Regularly run `go mod tidy` to clean module dependencies.
- Use verbose output or debug flags (if available) to get detailed error traces.

## 6. Where to Get Further Help

- Consult the [Installation & Setup Guide](/overview/integration-getting-started/installation-setup) for environment preparation.
- Refer to the [Quickstart Workflow](/overview/integration-getting-started/quickstart-workflow) to confirm your generation steps.
- See the [Project Setup & Model Definition](/getting-started/configuration/project-setup) for structuring your code.
- Explore the [Validating Your Generated APIs](/getting-started/validation/validating-generated-code) for testing generated artifacts.
- Open GitHub issues or check discussions at the [GORM CLI repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli).

<Check>
Ensure you are working in a supported Go environment and that your project follows GORM CLI conventions to avoid common pitfalls.
