# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your environment before installing and running GORM CLI to ensure a smooth and seamless experience. This page outlines the essential system requirements, dependencies, supported platforms, and access prerequisites necessary for successful setup.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in version 1.18. To use the CLI tool, your environment must have:

- **Go 1.18 or later** installed.

<Tip>
Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Ensure the output shows `go1.18` or higher.
</Tip>

## 2. Platform Compatibility

GORM CLI is designed to run on all major platforms supported by Go:

- **Linux** (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (Windows 10 and later recommended)

There are no additional platform-specific dependencies, so the installation process is uniform across systems.

## 3. Dependencies and Tools

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment has the following:

- **Go environment properly configured:** GOPATH, GOROOT, and PATH set according to your preferred setup.

- **SQLite, MySQL, or other supported databases:** While GORM CLI focuses on code generation rather than database management, you need a compatible database for running your application and tests.

- **Git (optional but recommended):** For pulling source repositories and managing project versions.

## 4. Access Requirements

- **Permissions to install Go tools:** You must have the appropriate permissions to run `go install` commands and install binaries in your Go environment.

- **File system access:** Ability to read/write files in your project directories for code generation outputs.

- **Network access (optional):** For fetching dependencies and updates via `go get` or `go install`.

## 5. Recommended System Specifications

While GORM CLI is lightweight, for effective development consider:

- **Memory:** At least 4 GB RAM for typical Go development and code generation workloads.

- **Disk Space:** Minimum 100 MB available to store generated code and dependencies.

- **CPU:** Modern multi-core processor to speed up compilation and generation.

## 6. Summary Table

| Requirement           | Details                              | Verification Command/Notes                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Go Version            | 1.18 or later                      | `go version`                             |
| OS                    | Linux, macOS, Windows              | Your operating system                     |
| Dependencies          | Go environment, database drivers   | Go toolchain installed                    |
| Permissions           | Write access to project directory  | Ensure no permission errors during install|
| Network (optional)    | Required to fetch packages          | Usually `go install` or `go get` works fine|

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Checklist">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Not Installed">
Check your Go installation with `go version`. If below 1.18 or not found, download and install the latest Go version from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment Variables Not Set Correctly">
Verify GOPATH and GOROOT environment variables. On some systems, these must be configured manually. Refer to the Go environment setup documentation for your OS.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions">
If installation commands fail with permission errors, either run commands with elevated privileges or adjust permissions on your Go workspace directories.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Database Drivers at Runtime">
Ensure you have imported the necessary GORM-compatible drivers (e.g., `gorm.io/driver/sqlite`) in your project. This is critical to run tests and the generated code effectively.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps After Prerequisites Check

Once your environment meets these requirements:

1. Proceed to **Installation Instructions** to install the GORM CLI tool.
2. Prepare your Go project by defining models and query interfaces as described in the Getting Started guides.
3. Continue with configuring your first code generation and running sample queries.

For further setup help, see [Installation](../installation-instructions) and [Quick Validation & Smoke Test](../quick-validation).
