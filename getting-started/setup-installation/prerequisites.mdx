# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GORM CLI

Before running GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the minimum requirements. This preparation guarantees a smooth installation, configuration, and first-use experience.

---

## 1. System Requirements

- **Operating Systems Supported:** GORM CLI runs on any OS that supports Go 1.18+, including:
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows

- **Go Version:**
  - Require Go 1.18 or later (due to generics usage in code generation).
  - To check your Go version, run:
    ```bash
    go version
    ```
  - Upgrade Go if the version is below 1.18.

- **Memory & Disk Space:**
  - Standard Go toolchain requirements (usually minimal).
  - Ensure sufficient disk space to store your Go projects, generated source files, and dependencies.

## 2. Dependencies

- **Go Toolchain:**
  - Install Go from the official website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
  - Confirm `go` is available in your system PATH.

- **Database and Drivers (Optional):**
  - Although GORM CLI does not depend on a live database connection for generation, your project might use specific database drivers (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - Make sure to add your database driver dependencies in your Go modules as needed.
  - Example: For MySQL use `gorm.io/driver/mysql`.

## 3. Access and Permissions

- No special system permissions are required to run GORM CLI.
- You must have read/write access to your Go project workspace and output directories.
- Confirm that your user account can execute Go commands and write files where the generated code will reside.

## 4. Network Requirements

- No mandatory network connectivity is required for running the CLI.
- However, to install GORM CLI (or dependencies) using `go install` or `go get`, you need active internet access for Go module resolution and downloads.

## Verifying Your Setup

Follow these steps to verify your environment before starting with GORM CLI:

```bash
# Verify Go version
go version

# Ensure go.mod present (run inside your project)
ls go.mod

# Test module download
go mod tidy

# Check if you can install GORM CLI tool
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Confirm installation
which gorm
```

<Tip>
Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your system PATH to run the `gorm` command globally.
</Tip>

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows:**
  - Use PowerShell or Command Prompt with Go installed.
  - Long file paths may cause issues; consider enabling long path support.

- **macOS/Linux:**
  - Use your preferred terminal.
  - Ensure correct permissions for your Go workspace.

- **CI/CD Environments:**
  - Ensure your build agents have Go 1.18+ installed.
  - Set up GOPATH and PATH environment variables correctly.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Using Go version below 1.18 will cause GORM CLI generation to fail silently or with cryptic errors.
- Ensure that your Go environment environment variables (e.g., GOPATH, GOBIN) are set correctly for your shell.
- If running behind proxies, configure `GOPROXY` accordingly to avoid module download failures.
- Be mindful of file system permissions when generating output in protected directories.

## Next Steps

Once your environment is ready:

1. Proceed to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation) to install GORM CLI.
2. After installation, validate your setup in the [Validating Your Installation](/getting-started/setup-installation/validation) page.
3. Explore minimal configuration and start generating your first typeâ€‘safe query APIs.
