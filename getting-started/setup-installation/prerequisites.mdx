# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Starting your journey with GORM CLI begins with ensuring your environment is properly prepared. This page outlines the essential software versions, platform support, and dependencies you must have in place to successfully install and run GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** to function correctly. This is necessary because GORM CLI leverages Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, to generate type-safe query APIs.

### Verify Your Go Version

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your version is anything below 1.18, upgrade Go before proceeding.

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GORM CLI supports all platforms where Go 1.18+ runs smoothly, including:

- **Linux** (amd64, arm64)
- **macOS** (amd64, arm64)
- **Windows** (amd64)

Ensure you are using a supported OS and architecture.


---

## 3. Required Software & Dependencies

Before installing GORM CLI, confirm the following are available:

- **Go toolchain**: The `go` command must be in your system's PATH.
- **Network access**: Required to download GORM CLI and its dependencies using `go install`.

Optionally, for debugging and deeper troubleshooting:

- **A Go-aware editor or IDE** such as VS Code with Go plugins.
- **Access to your project’s Go modules** to resolve dependencies that GORM CLI requires.


---

## 4. System Resources

GORM CLI runs efficiently on typical development machines. Minimum system requirements:

| Resource         | Minimum Recommended          |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| RAM              | 2 GB                        |
| Disk Space       | 100 MB free (for generated files) |
| CPU              | Any modern x86_64 or ARM64 CPU |


---

## 5. Access & Permissions

To install and run GORM CLI, you need:

- **Command-line access** on your development machine
- **Permission to install Go packages** into your module cache (typically no elevated privileges needed)
- **Write permissions** to the directory where you plan to generate code


---

## 6. Network & Firewall Considerations

Since installation involves retrieving modules from public repositories (e.g., `gorm.io/cli/gorm`), ensure:

- Your machine can access the Internet or your private Go module proxy
- Firewall or proxy settings do not block `go install` or `go get` commands


---

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">

If running `go version` reports a version older than 1.18:

- Download and install the latest Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Reopen your terminal or refresh your PATH variable.
- Verify again with `go version`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go Command Not Found">

If you get `command not found: go`:

- Confirm Go is installed properly.
- Add the Go binary directory (e.g., `/usr/local/go/bin`) to your system PATH.
- Restart your terminal session.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Issues During Installation">

If installation fails due to network errors:

- Check your internet connectivity.
- If behind a corporate proxy, configure Go proxy environment variables correctly (`GOPROXY`, `GONOPROXY`).
- Try installing again or download modules manually.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Write Permissions">

If you receive permission errors writing output directories when generating code:

- Ensure you have write access to your project and output directories.
- Run generation commands from your user account with proper folder permissions.
