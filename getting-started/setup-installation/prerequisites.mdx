# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the essential requirements to run **GORM CLI** successfully. To ensure a smooth installation, configuration, and usage experience, review and prepare your development environment according to the criteria below.

---

## 1. Go Language Requirements

GORM CLI leverages Go generics and advanced type safety; therefore, your Go environment must meet the minimum version requirements for compatibility.

- **Minimum Go Version:** 1.18 or higher

  >> Go 1.18+ is required because it introduced generics, a critical feature used extensively by GORM CLI's code generation and fluent APIs.

- Verify your Go version with:
  ```bash
  go version
  ```

  The output should be `go version go1.18 ...` or newer.

## 2. GORM Version Recommendations

GORM CLI generates code tightly integrated with the GORM ORM library. To leverage the full power and compatibility of generated APIs and helpers:

- Use **GORM version 1.23 or later**.
- This ensures support for the latest field helper types, association semantics, and SQL template DSL features.

:::tip
If you encounter compatibility issues, upgrading your GORM dependency to the latest stable release is highly recommended.
:::

## 3. Supported Platforms & Environment

GORM CLI is designed for local development workflows and requires a Go development environment on your platform.

- **Supported Operating Systems:**
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows (via PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Windows Subsystem for Linux)

- **Additional Tools:**
  - A terminal or shell environment with Go command line tools installed.
  - Network connectivity is only required if pulling dependencies (e.g., running `go get` or `go install`).

:::note
No special Docker or container setup is necessary, though you may use containers for your application database or other services as usual.
:::

## 4. Environmental Variables and Paths

- Ensure your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` are configured to include the Go binary locations.
- After installing GORM CLI, make sure the binary directory (`$GOPATH/bin`) is on your `PATH` to invoke `gorm` from any location.

## 5. Network and Firewall Considerations

- No specific firewall rules or open ports are required for running GORM CLI locally.
- If integrating with remote databases during development, ensure your network settings allow connections to those database hosts.

---

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to installation, validate the following:

- [ ] Go version is 1.18 or higher (run `go version`).
- [ ] GORM dependency in your project is at least version 1.23.
- [ ] Go toolchain and `gor` binary paths are properly set.
- [ ] Your OS is supported, and terminal access is available.

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">

If you run `gorm gen -h` or other CLI commands and get errors related to unsupported language features, confirm your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If below 1.18, upgrade Go using your OS package manager or from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM Version Mismatch">

Generated APIs may fail to work if your GORM version predates required features.

- Check your `go.mod` for `gorm.io/gorm` version.
- Upgrade with:
  ```bash
  go get -u gorm.io/gorm
  ```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm` Command Not Found After Installation">

If after installation the `gorm` CLI command fails:

- Confirm `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system `PATH`.
- On Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  echo $PATH
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```
- On Windows:
  - Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your environment `Path` variable.

</Accordion>

## Next Steps

Now that your environment meets the prerequisites, proceed to the **Installation** guide to set up GORM CLI on your machine.

- [Installation Guide](../installation)
- Once installed, refer to [Initial Configuration](../configuration-setup) to customize generation.
