# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before you begin using GORM CLI, verify that your development environment meets the essential system requirements and dependencies. This ensures a smooth installation and the correct operation of the CLI tool when generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven helpers.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms & Environments

GORM CLI is designed to run in standard Go development environments. It supports the following:

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or later (required due to generics usage)

Ensure that your system has Go 1.18+ installed and properly configured.

### How to check your Go version

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
go version go1.18 darwin/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, you will need to update Go before proceeding.

---

## 2. Required Dependencies

GORM CLI depends on several external Go modules and libraries to function:

- **Go Modules:** The CLI uses Go modules for dependency management.
- **GORM v2:** The underlying ORM library integrated with the generated APIs.
- **Cobra:** The CLI command framework used by GORM CLI.

These dependencies are resolved automatically during the installation of the CLI via `go install`.

---

## 3. Network & Access Requirements

- Internet connectivity is required to:
  - Download Go modules (including GORM and Cobra) if not previously cached.
  - Install the CLI tool using `go install`.

- Your firewall or proxy settings must allow outbound HTTPS access for Go module downloads.

- Access to your project source files and generated output directories must have appropriate file system permissions.

---

## 4. Environment Preparation Checks

Before installing and running GORM CLI, perform these initial checks:

### Step 1: Verify Go toolchain and environment

```bash
go env
```

Verify GOPATH, GOROOT, and PATH include Go binaries.

### Step 2: Ensure Go 1.18+ is active

```bash
go version
```

(Refer to earlier section)

### Step 3: Confirm directory permissions for code generation

Verify write access to the directory where you plan to generate code (default `./g` or custom via `-o`).

```bash
touch ./g/testfile && rm ./g/testfile
```

If this fails, adjust file system permissions.

### Step 4: Validate network access

Try a module download or ping to `proxy.golang.org`:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/cli/gorm
```

If there are errors, check network/firewall settings.

---

## 5. Summary Checklist

Before proceeding to installation, confirm the following:

- [x] Go 1.18 or newer is installed and active (`go version`)
- [x] Your OS platform is supported (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [x] Your terminal environment recognizes Go executables (`go env`)
- [x] Outbound network access to download Go modules is enabled
- [x] You have proper permissions to write to the output directory

## 6. Troubleshooting Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">
If your version is below 1.18:
- Download the latest Go installer from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
- Follow platform-specific installation instructions.
- Update your terminal's PATH to point to the new Go version.
- Verify with `go version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Errors When Installing">
- Check your proxy environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`).
- Ensure firewall allows access to `proxy.golang.org` and `sum.golang.org`.
- Temporarily disable VPNs or proxies to isolate issues.
- Use `GOPROXY=direct go get ...` to bypass proxy if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors When Generating Code">
- Confirm you have write access to your project root or specified output directory.
- Use `chmod` or file explorer to grant write permissions.
- Avoid running inside protected system directories.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

Once all prerequisites are verified:

- Proceed to the [Installing GORM CLI](./installing-cli) guide to install the CLI tool.
- Review [Basic Configuration](../first-steps/initial-configuration) to prepare your project for generation.
