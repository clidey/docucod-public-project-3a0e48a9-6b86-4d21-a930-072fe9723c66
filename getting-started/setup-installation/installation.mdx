# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

Welcome to the definitive guide on installing **GORM CLI** using the Go toolchain. This step-by-step walkthrough is designed to help you get GORM CLI up and running on your system quickly and confidently, regardless of your platform.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you dive into installation, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later (generics are required).
- **Supported Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux (with Go installed).
- **Go Environment Setup**: `GOPATH` and `PATH` configured properly to allow `go install` commands to place binaries in an executable location.

<Check>
Make sure running `go version` outputs 1.18 or higher:

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.19 linux/amd64
```
</Check>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

The recommended and simplest way to install GORM CLI is via the Go toolchain's `go install` command.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Using Go Toolchain">
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches the latest GORM CLI version and installs the `gorm` binary to your Go bin directory (typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Go Binary Path">
Confirm that your Go binary path is in your system's `PATH` environment variable. For example:

- On Linux/macOS:

  Add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
  
  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- On Windows:

  Ensure `%GOPATH%\bin` is added to your system PATH.

</Step>
<Step title="Check Installation Success">
After installation, verify that the `gorm` CLI is accessible and check its version:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output should display the GORM CLI version string without error.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS & Linux

- Installation via `go install` is straightforward if Go is installed via package managers or official binaries.
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure your Go bin directory is writable or use `sudo` cautiously (not generally recommended).

### Windows

- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt with appropriate privileges.
- Confirm that Go is installed and environment variables are properly set.
- If PowerShell gives execution policy errors, adjust policy settings temporarily or permanently as per your security requirements.

---

## 4. Post-Installation Verification

After installation, confirm that GORM CLI is correctly installed and working:

1. Open a new terminal session to refresh environment variables.
2. Run:

```bash
gorm help
```

This should display the CLI’s help text listing commands and usage.

<Tip>
If you see an error like `command not found` or `gorm: command not recognized`, double-check your `PATH` environment variable includes the Go bin directory where `gorm` was installed.
</Tip>
