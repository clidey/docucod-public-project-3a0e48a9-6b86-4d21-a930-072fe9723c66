# Installation

Step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool on supported platforms using Go's tooling. This guide provides precise commands, platform-specific notes, and how to verify the installation success.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later is required since GORM CLI depends on Go generics support.
- **Supported Platforms**: GORM CLI can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux, wherever Go tooling is supported.
- **Networking**: Internet access is required to download the package using `go install`.

<Tip>
Verify you have Go properly installed and configured by running:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output indicating Go version 1.18 or higher.

If Go is not installed, visit https://golang.org/dl/ to download and install the appropriate version for your OS.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

The recommended method to install GORM CLI is using the `go install` command, which downloads and compiles the CLI tool directly from the GORM CLI module.

### Step-by-Step Installation Command

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command installs the latest version of GORM CLI.
- By default, binaries are installed to the directory specified by your Go environment variable `GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin`.

### Platform Nuances

- **Windows**:
  - Ensure your PATH environment variable includes the Go bin directory (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`) to run `gorm` from any command line.
- **macOS/Linux**:
  - Confirm your PATH includes `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.
  - If not, add it to your shell configuration (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

---

## 3. Verifying the Installation

After installation, check that the `gorm` CLI is installed and accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI usage details with a list of available commands.

<Tip>
If you receive a "command not found" error:

- Confirm the binary directory is in your PATH.
- Ensure the installation command completed without errors.
- Verify your Go environment with `go env GOPATH` and `go env GOBIN`.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Basic Usage Example

To quickly confirm your installation works, you can run the built-in code generator help or try generating code (assuming you have an input interface file ready):

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

This prints detailed help for the `gen` command.

To generate code, use:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces.go -o ./generated
```

Replace `./path/to/interfaces.go` with your actual interfaces file location.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
- Ensure the Go bin path is in your system PATH environment variable.
- On Linux/macOS, run `echo $PATH` and verify the Go bin directory is listed.
- On Windows, check Environment Variables in System Settings.

If missing, add the path and restart your terminal.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
- GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or later.
- Run `go version` to check your Go version.
- Upgrade Go from https://golang.org/dl/ if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Permission Errors During Installation">
- Ensure you have stable internet connectivity.
- If access to external Go modules is blocked, configure your proxy or allow network traffic for Go tooling.
- Run the install command with sufficient permissions.
</Accordion>
