# Validating Your Installation

Ensure your GORM CLI installation is correct, accessible, and functioning as expected with these quick checks and basic commands. This verification step confirms the CLI tool is ready for code generation tasks and integrates properly with your shell environment.

---

## 1. Confirm CLI Availability from Your Shell

Before running any generation commands, verify that the `gorm` CLI is installed and reachable:

```bash
gorm version
```

- **Expected output**: Display of the GORM CLI version number, confirming the CLI responds.

<Tip>
If you see a 'command not found' error, your Go binaries might not be in your system's `PATH`. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or your Go binary directory is included in your environment variables.
</Tip>

## 2. Basic CLI Command Check

Run the help command to confirm the CLI can display usage information:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- **Expected output**: A list of available commands and flags, including the `gen` command for code generation.

<Tip>
A responsive help menu indicates your CLI binary is correctly installed and executable.
</Tip>

## 3. Validate `gen` Command Invocation

Invoke the generation command without required flags to see the usage hint:

```bash
gorm gen
```

- **Expected output**: Usage information stating the need for the `--input` flag to specify your interface file.

<Note>
This confirms that the CLI recognizes the `gen` command and enforces required parameters.
</Note>

## 4. Verify Go Installation Compatibility

The GORM CLI requires **Go version 1.18 or higher** due to generics support. Confirm your Go compiler version:

```bash
go version
```

- **Expected output**: Something like `go version go1.18 linux/amd64` or newer.

<Warning>
Using an older Go version will cause installation or runtime failures. Upgrade your Go version if needed.
</Warning>

## 5. Quick Test for CLI Execution

Run a simple generation command against an example interface file (replace with your real path):

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

- **Expected output**: Generation process logs indicating files created or updated inside the specified output directory.

<Check>
- You should see "Generating file" messages.
- No error messages.
- Output files appear in the target `./generated` directory.
</Check>

<Tip>
If errors occur, re-check your input file path and ensure your Go interfaces use SQL annotations as required.
</Tip>

## 6. Additional Verification: Binary Location

Confirm the `gorm` binary location:

```bash
which gorm
```

- **Expected output**: Full path to your `gorm` executable, such as `/home/user/go/bin/gorm`.

<Note>
This helps verify that your shell points to the correct CLI binary especially if multiple Go versions or environments exist.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Steps">
<Accordion title="'command not found' when running gorm">
Check that your Go bin directory is included in the `PATH` environment variable.

For Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version too low">
Upgrade your Go installation to 1.18 or later. Visit https://go.dev/dl/ to download the latest version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Input file path errors">
Ensure the input path to `gorm gen -i` points to a Go file containing properly annotated interfaces, as documented in the [Installing GORM CLI](getting-started/setup-installation/installing-cli) page.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output directory permissions errors">
Make sure you have write permissions to the output directory you specify with `-o`. Run the command with sufficient user privileges.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

- After confirming your installation, proceed to write your first query interface and model, then generate code.
- Refer to [Quickstart: Your First Workflow](getting-started/project-configuration-run/quickstart-overview) to run a complete generation cycle.
- Consult [Basic Configuration & Structure](getting-started/project-configuration-run/basic-config-setup) to prepare your project setup for GORM CLI.

---

## Summary

Validating your installation ensures the CLI is correctly installed, callable, and compatible with your Go environment. Simple commands like `gorm version`, `gorm --help`, and a test generation help you confirm readiness before deeper integration.

For any issues, troubleshoot environment variables, Go versions, and file paths early to avoid cascading errors during generation.
