# Validate Your Installation

Confirming your installation of **GORM CLI** is a critical step to ensure your development environment is correctly set up and the CLI tool is fully operational. This page guides you through running simple commands to check your installation, interpret outputs, and troubleshoot basic issues.

---

## 1. Purpose of Validation

After installing GORM CLI via the Go toolchain, you want to be confident that:

- The `gorm` CLI binary is accessible from your command line.
- The CLI responds correctly to basic commands.
- Any environment or path issues are uncovered early.

This quick validation helps avoid confusion during later coding and generation workflows.

---

## 2. Confirming Installation

Follow these steps to verify that GORM CLI is installed and working:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check CLI Version and Help">
Run the help command to display basic usage information and confirm the binary is accessible.

```bash
gorm --help
```

**Expected outcome:**
- A list of commands available in GORM CLI is shown.
- Usage instructions and description of subcommands like `gen` appear.

If you see a command not found error, it means the CLI binary is either not installed or not in your system's executable path.
</Step>

<Step title="Run a Simple Version Check">
Get the version of the installed GORM CLI tool:

```bash
gorm version
```

**Expected outcome:**
- The currently installed GORM CLI version string displays on your terminal.

This confirms the CLI tool runs successfully and can output version metadata.
</Step>

<Step title="Test the `gen` Subcommand Help">
Since code generation is the core feature, check `gen` subcommand help:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

**Expected outcome:**
- CLI shows flags and usage instructions specific to the `gen` command, including input and output options.

This confirms that core commands are properly registered and available.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Troubleshooting Basic Installation Issues

If the above commands do not behave as expected, use the following troubleshooting tips:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found or CLI Not Recognized">
- **Cause:** The `gorm` executable is not in your system PATH.
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure you installed GORM CLI using:

    ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

  - Confirm your Go binary installation path is added to your PATH environment variable.
    Typically:
    - Linux/macOS: `$HOME/go/bin`
    - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`

  - After adding it, restart your terminal or apply changes.

- Verify installation by running:

  ```bash
which gorm
# or
where gorm (Windows)
```

- If still not found, reinstall following official [Installation Instructions](getting-started/setup-installation/installation-instructions).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied or Access Issues">
- **Cause:** Insufficient permission to execute the CLI binary.
- **Solution:**
  - On Unix-based systems, run:

    ```bash
chmod +x $(which gorm)
```

  - On Windows, ensure your terminal has enough privilege or run as Administrator.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Version Command Fails or Outputs Unexpected Text">
- **Cause:** Corrupted binary or broken Go installation.
- **Solution:**
  - Remove the existing CLI binary from your Go bin directory.
  - Run a fresh install:

    ```bash
go clean -modcache
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

  - Confirm your Go environment is set to version 1.18 or higher. Check with:

    ```bash
go version
```

- For environment misconfigurations, see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-requirements).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Errors on Running Commands">
- **Cause:** Conflicts with other packages or broken dependencies.
- **Solution:**
  - Check your Go module settings and ensure `gorm.io/cli/gorm` module is downloaded correctly.
  - Try running in a clean, minimal Go project environment.
  - Look for any error messages in the terminal and cross-reference with [Common Installation Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting/common-install-errors).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. What to Expect on Success

When validation succeeds:

- Running `gorm --help` or `gorm gen --help` outputs usage information instantly.
- Running `gorm version` shows a semantic version string matching the latest or installed CLI release.
- No error messages appear in typical CLI commands.

At this point, you have a working GORM CLI environment, and you can proceed confidently to code generation and integration workflows.

---

## 5. Next Steps After Validation

1. **Review Quickstart Workflow:** Begin your first code generation with [Quick Start: Your First Code Generation](/getting-started/first-steps/quickstart-basic-usage).

2. **Explore Configuration:** Customize your generation with [Configuration & Customization](/getting-started/first-steps/configuration-setup).

3. **Validate Generated Code:** Learn how to check your generated output at [Validating the Generated Code](/getting-started/first-steps/validating-generated-code).

4. **Consult Troubleshooting:** Keep the [Common Installation Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-install-errors) page handy for problems beyond basic validation.
