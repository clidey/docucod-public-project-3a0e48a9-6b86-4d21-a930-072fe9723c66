# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common issues encountered during the installation and initial setup of GORM CLI. If you experience version mismatches, dependency errors, or command execution problems, follow these steps to recover swiftly and continue with confidence.

---

## 1. Common Setup Issues and How to Resolve Them

### 1.1 Version Mismatch Errors

**Problem:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to the use of generics. Using an older Go version causes installation or runtime errors.

**Solution:**

1. Check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

2. If below 1.18, update Go to the latest stable version from https://golang.org/dl/

3. After updating, verify `go` is properly installed and in your `PATH`.

4. Re-install GORM CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

<Tip>
Updating Go ensures compatibility with generics, which is critical for GORM CLI to function correctly.
</Tip>

---

### 1.2 Installation Command Not Found or Permission Denied

**Problem:** Running `gorm` or `gorm gen` fails with command not found or permission errors.

**Solution:**

- Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your system `PATH`.

- Verify with:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

- Add to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- Reload your shell or restart the terminal.

- Try running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

to confirm CLI availability.

<Tip>
On Windows, ensure the Go bin directory is included in the system environment variables.
</Tip>

### 1.3 Dependency and Module Errors During Installation

**Problem:** Errors like `cannot find module` or `vendor directory missing` appear during `go install` or `gorm gen` execution.

**Solution:**

- Make sure you are running inside a valid Go module (`go.mod` present).

- Initialize a module if missing:

```bash
go mod init your/module/name
```

- Sync dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

- Reinstall GORM CLI.

- If a private module or proxy is involved, check network access and GOPRIVATE settings.

<Tip>
Using Go modules properly ensures dependency resolution, preventing build-time errors.
</Tip>

---

### 1.4 Incorrect Usage of `gorm gen` Command

**Problem:** Running the generator returns errors like "error processing" or "flag required: input".

**Solution:**

- The `-i` (or `--input`) flag specifying the Go interface file or directory is required.

Example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- Make sure the input path points to Go source files with interface definitions that contain SQL templates.

- Confirm the output directory exists or will be created by the CLI.

- Use `gorm gen --help` to review command syntax.

<Note>
The generator only supports Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates as input.
</Note>

---

### 1.5 Errors Relating to Generated Code Usage

**Problem:** After generation, trying to use the generated code produces compilation or runtime errors.

**Solution:**

- Verify that the generated code has been regenerated after any modification in your interfaces or models.

- Run the generator again:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./your/interfaces -o ./generated
```

- Ensure your Go module imports the generated package correctly.

- Check for any field or type mismatches, especially after changing model definitions.

- Review your `genconfig.Config` for custom mappings that might affect generation.

---

## 2. Best Practices to Avoid Setup Issues

- Always use Go 1.18 or later.
- Confirm your `$PATH` includes Go bin directories.
- Use Go modules for dependency management.
- Keep interface and model definitions organized in your input paths.
- Regularly regenerate code after updates.
- Use the CLI help commands to confirm options:

```bash
gorm --help
gorm gen --help
```

- Review example projects bundled with GORM CLI to compare structure and usage.

## 3. Quick Recovery Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Go Version">
Run `go version` and ensure it reports 1.18 or newer.
</Step>
<Step title="Check PATH for Go Bin">
Confirm `%PATH%` or `$PATH` includes `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize and Tidy Modules">
Use `go mod init` and `go mod tidy` in your project root.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Installation">
Install CLI with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Correct gen Command">
Use `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./path/to/output`.
</Step>
<Step title="Re-generate After Changes">
Always re-run generation after editing interfaces or models.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Installation & Setup Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Compatibility">
Ensure Go 1.18+ is installed, else the CLI fails due to generics usage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="PATH Not Updated">
Add Go bin directory to PATH to access `gorm` command after install.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Input Flag">
The `-i` input flag is mandatory; omit it to see an error prompting for input.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied on Mac/Linux">
Use `chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm` or run install with sudo if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Module Dependency Errors">
Run `go mod tidy` to fix missing dependencies.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Do not manually edit generated files as they will be overwritten on subsequent generation runs.
</Warning>
