# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and running the GORM CLI tool, it is crucial to ensure your environment meets the necessary software prerequisites. This guarantees a smooth installation process and enables the CLI to function as intended, allowing you to generate type-safe, fluent GORM query APIs reliably.

---

## 1. Go Version Compatibility

- **Minimum Required Go Version:** Go 1.18 or higher

GORM CLI relies on Go 1.18+ because it extensively uses Go generics, which were introduced in this version. Attempting to use an older version will result in build failures or runtime issues.

**Check your Go version:**
```bash
go version
```

Expected output when compatible:
```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is older than 1.18, please upgrade to the latest stable release from the official Go downloads page: https://golang.org/dl/

---

## 2. Required Dependencies

- **GORM CLI binary installation:**

The tool is distributed as a Go module. To install it, ensure you have a working Go environment and an active internet connection to fetch the module.

**Install command:**
```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches the latest GORM CLI module and installs the `gorm` executable in your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory.

- **GORM (gorm.io/gorm):**

Since the generated code integrates with the GORM ORM, your project needs to include GORM as a dependency. Typically this is handled in your Go projectâ€™s `go.mod`:

```bash
require gorm.io/gorm v1.x.x
```

Make sure your application imports and uses the same GORM version compatible with the generated code.

---

## 3. Environment & Network Considerations

- **Internet Access:** Required during installation to download the CLI module and dependent Go packages.
- **File System Permissions:** Ensure you have write permissions in your target directory for output code generation.
- **Firewall & Proxy:** If working behind a corporate proxy or firewall, configure your environment accordingly to allow `go install` and module fetches.

## 4. Recommended System Specifications

While GORM CLI is a lightweight tool, the following system specs support optimal performance:

| Component     | Recommendation                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Operating System | Any OS supporting Go 1.18+ (Linux, macOS, Windows) |
| Memory        | Minimum 2GB RAM               |
| Disk Space    | At least 100MB free space to accommodate Go modules and generated code |
| CPU           | Modern multi-core processor for faster code generation |

---

## 5. Summary Checklist

Please verify the following before proceeding:

- [ ] Go version is 1.18 or higher
- [ ] Network connectivity to fetch Go modules
- [ ] GORM dependency installed in your project
- [ ] Permissions to write to your output folder

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Go version is too low or not installed">
Ensure Go is installed by running `go version`. If the output reports a version lower than 1.18, download and install the latest Go release from https://golang.org/dl/.

After installation, verify by reopening your terminal and running `go version` again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cannot install GORM CLI via `go install`">
Check your environment variables: `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`. Ensure the Go bin directory is in your system PATH so you can run the `gorm` command after installation.

If behind a proxy or firewall, configure your Go environment to use proxy settings:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

Or set appropriate corporate proxy variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Write permission denied on output directory">
Make sure you have permissions to create files and folders in your chosen output path. Change directory ownership or choose a different folder as needed.

Example:
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/output
chmod u+w /path/to/output
```
</Accordion>
