# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and using GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the required standards to guarantee a smooth setup and effective operation. This page guides you through the minimal system setup, Go version compatibility, network considerations, and essential dependencies.

---

## 1. System Requirements

GORM CLI is designed to run on modern development environments. The minimum system requirements include:

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows, macOS, or Linux (64-bit preferred)
  - Compatible with any OS supporting Go 1.18 or higher
- **Memory:** Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended for large projects)
- **Disk Space:** At least 100MB free space for installation and generated code
- **Processor:** Any modern x86_64 or ARM64 CPU

> GORM CLI operates as a command-line tool, so a terminal or shell environment capable of running Go commands is essential.


## 2. Go Language Version

GORM CLI requires the Go programming language environment to be configured on your machine. Follow these requirements:

- **Minimum Go version:** 1.18
- **Recommended version:** Go 1.20 or above

You can verify your Go installation and version by running:

```bash
go version
```

If you need to install or upgrade Go, please visit the official site: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)


## 3. Dependencies & Tools

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed before proceeding:

- **MySQL Server:**
  - Only if you plan to connect to MySQL databases.
  - Example configurations use the latest official MySQL Docker image.
- **Docker (optional):**
  - Recommended for easy containerized database setup.
  - Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS or Docker Engine on Linux.
- **Go Modules Enabled:**
  - GORM CLI expects Go modules (`go.mod`) for source organization.


## 4. Network and Access Requirements

Since GORM CLI interacts with your databases locally or remotely, consider these networking points:

- **MySQL Default Ports:**
  - Typical MySQL service runs on port 3306.
  - Example Docker Compose settings forward port `127.0.0.1:9910:3306`, binding MySQL locally at port 9910 to avoid conflicts.
- **Firewall/Network:**
  - Local firewall or network security settings must allow connections to configured ports.
- **Credentials:**
  - You need valid database credentials matching your target database user.
  - Example environment variables for MySQL:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=gorm
      - MYSQL_USER=gorm
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=gorm
    ```


## 5. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Go Installation">
Run `go version` and ensure it is 1.18 or newer.
</Step>
<Step title="Prepare Your Database">
Use Docker or an existing MySQL server; ensure port accessibility and credentials.
</Step>
<Step title="Check System Resources">
Confirm your machine meets minimum memory and disk space requirements.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Network Ports">
Ensure local firewalls do not block MySQL ports (default or customized).
</Step>
</Steps>


## 6. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<Tip>
If Go commands fail, check that your GOPATH and PATH environment variables include the Go binary directory.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Running MySQL on conflicting ports can cause startup failure. Use local forwarding or change the port in your Docker Compose file.
</Warning>

<Note>
Always use strong passwords for database users in production environments, unlike the default example credentials.
</Note>
