# Validating Your Installation

This guide helps you quickly verify that GORM CLI is properly installed and ready to use in your development environment. By running several straightforward commands, you can confirm the tool’s presence, check its version, and troubleshoot common startup issues.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Is Installed

Once you have installed GORM CLI using `go install`, verify it is accessible in your shell by running:

```bash
gorm version
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Displays the installed GORM CLI version number.
- No errors indicating command not found.

If this command fails with "command not found" or similar, ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go binary installation directory is included in your system’s PATH.

<Tip>
On Unix-like systems, you can add this to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

On Windows, add the Go bin directory to the system PATH environment variable.
</Tip>

## 2. Check the CLI Help Output

To confirm the CLI tool runs and lists available commands, execute:

```bash
gorm --help
```

This command should return usage instructions and a list of available commands, including the `gen` subcommand for code generation.

**Success indicator:** Help text is displayed without error.

## 3. Validate the Generator Command

Try running the help for the code generator specifically:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

You should see detailed usage info for the `gen` command, including available flags like `-i` (input path) and `-o` (output path).

## 4. Run a Basic Generation Dry-Run (Optional)

If you have a sample project or interface files ready, test generation with dry-run style output to verify the tool’s core functionality:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated --dry-run
```

This will parse the inputs, process code generation in memory, and display logs but not write files.

**Expected:** The tool completes with no fatal or parsing errors, outputting file paths and progress messages.

## 5. Common Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="'gorm: command not found'">
Make sure the Go bin directory is in your PATH because `go install` installs the binary there.

**Fix:**
- Add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to your PATH.
- Restart your terminal session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version command errors or unexpected output">
Ensure you installed a valid release with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Reinstall if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied errors when running GORM CLI">
Check permissions of the installed binary and your user privileges.

On Unix-like systems:

```bash
chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```

Run command with sufficient rights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to generate code for interfaces or models">
Verify your input path is correct and contains Go interface or struct files.

Check the input directory structure and contents.

Ensure the Go files compile without syntax errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Verify the Generated Code Appears

After running a successful generation command, check that the output directory (default is `generated` or as specified) contains:

- Generated Go files corresponding to your interfaces and models.
- Files should be properly formatted and free of compile errors.

## 7. Next Steps

Once you have confirmed the installation is correct, proceed to:

- **Basic Configuration & Project Setup:** Learn how to prepare your project and configure generation options.
- **Running Your First Code Generation:** Step through generating your first type-safe query APIs and model helpers.
- **Using the Generated APIs:** Understand how to integrate generated code in your application.

These guides help you turn a successful install into effective development.
