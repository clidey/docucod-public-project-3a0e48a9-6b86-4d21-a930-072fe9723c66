# Quick Validation & Smoke Test

Validate your GORM CLI installation quickly to ensure the tool is correctly set up and ready for use. This page walks you through simple commands to check the availability and version of the CLI, along with actionable tips if the CLI command is not recognized.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation

The first step after installation is to verify that the `gorm` command line tool is properly installed and accessible from your terminal.

### Step-by-Step Validation

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to check for the `gorm` CLI availability:

```bash
gorm version
```

- **Expected outcome:** The terminal prints the installed version of GORM CLI.

Example output:

```bash
GORM CLI version 0.x.x
```


### Troubleshooting CLI Not Found

If your terminal returns an error like `command not found: gorm` or `gorm is not recognized as an internal or external command`, follow these tips:

- Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go's bin directory (usually `$HOME/go/bin`) is added to your system's PATH environment variable.
- Verify you installed the CLI with the correct Go version (Go 1.18+).
- Try reinstalling using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- Open a new terminal session or reload your shell profile after modifying PATH.

<Tip>
If you are on Windows, confirm your environment variables include the Go `bin` path in `System Properties > Environment Variables > Path`.
</Tip>

## 2. Run a Basic Command

The `version` command is the simplest way to confirm the tool is responsive.

```bash
gorm version
```

You can also run the root help command to list available subcommands:

```bash
gorm --help
```

This should output usage information including commands like `gen` (code generation).

---

## 3. Validate CLI Functionality with a Smoke Test

Once you confirm the CLI is accessible, perform a basic smoke test by running the `gen` command without arguments.

```bash
gorm gen
```

Expected behavior:

- The CLI should print usage help or error messages if configuration or input paths are missing.
- It confirms the CLI can start and parse commands.

<Tip>
If you see errors related to missing input paths, this confirms the CLI is installed and working but requires arguments for actual generation.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Use Quick Validation Scripts (Optional)

If you want a full affirmation of proper CLI operation, you can write a quick Go script or use an example package with simple interfaces and models to run the generator and verify output.

Example validation:

- Create a small example with a Go file defining a `Query[T]` interface and a model struct.
- Run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- Check that the generated code appears in the output directory.

See [Your First Code Generation](https://docs.gorm.io/guides/getting-started/your-first-generation) for a detailed walkthrough.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Fixes

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Remedies">
<Accordion title="'gorm' command not found">
- Ensure Go 1.18+ is installed.
- Check that the Go bin directory is added to your PATH.
- Try reinstalling with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Restart your terminal or command prompt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version command shows unexpected errors">
- Confirm your Go environment is configured properly (run `go version`).
- Check your project's Go modules and environment.
- Verify that no conflicting tools named `gorm` exist in your PATH.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Gen command fails due to missing input">
- The `gen` command requires an input directory or file with interfaces/models.
- Make sure to provide the `-i` option pointing to your source directory.
- Refer to the installation and first run guides to set up example input files.
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

Once you confirm the CLI is installed and running correctly:

- Proceed to writing your first query interfaces and models.
- Follow the [Your First Code Generation](https://docs.gorm.io/guides/getting-started/your-first-generation) guide to generate APIs.
- Explore the [Basic Configuration](https://docs.gorm.io/guides/getting-started/basic-configuration) to customize generation.
