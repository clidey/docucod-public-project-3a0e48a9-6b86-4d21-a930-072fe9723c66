# Prerequisites & Requirements for GORM CLI

Welcome to the first essential step in your journey with GORM CLI. This guide ensures you have the right environment and understanding to use GORM CLI effectively for generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers in your Go projects. Preparing properly upfront saves time and headaches later.

---

## 1. System Requirements

GORM CLI is a powerful Go code generation tool tailored for projects using GORM. To run it smoothly, make sure your development setup meets the following:

- **Go Version:** Must be Go 1.18 or higher to support generics, a core dependency for GORM CLI's code generation.
- **Operating System:** Compatible with all major OS platforms supporting Go, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Memory & Disk:** No special minimum requirements beyond those typical for Go development.

<Tip>
Always use the latest stable Go release (1.18+) to ensure compatibility with GORM CLI’s generics-based features.
</Tip>

## 2. Expected Project Structure

For GORM CLI to generate accurate code, your Go project should follow some conventions:

- **Models Package:** Define your GORM model structs in one or more Go packages or directories. These structs represent your database tables.

- **Query Interfaces:** Place interfaces annotated with SQL templates in the same package or directory where the models live.

- **Annotations:** Use method comments on interfaces to define SQL templates for queries, updates, or filters.

Here’s a simple example layout:

```plaintext
/my-go-project
  /models
    user.go       # Defines User struct
  /queries
    user_query.go # Defines interfaces with SQL templates
```

Alternatively, both models and interfaces can be in the same package or directory, allowing GORM CLI to process them together.

Consistent packaging helps GORM CLI locate models and interfaces seamlessly for code generation.
</Check>

## 3. Required Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed and accessible to get started:

- **GORM:** Go ORM library (`gorm.io/gorm`). GORM CLI complements this with generated query APIs and helpers.
- **GORM CLI Binary:** Installable via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- **Cobra CLI:** Embedded in GORM CLI for command-line functionality (handled automatically).

You can install GORM CLI using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` path should be in your shell’s PATH to call the `gorm` command directly.

<Note>
If you use Go modules, running the installation command is sufficient without manual vendor setup.
</Note>

## 4. Access and Permissions

- **File System Access:** The CLI reads your Go interface files and writes generated code to output directories. Ensure you have read/write permissions on these paths.
- **Network Access:** No network access is required for generation after installation.

## 5. Network and Environment Considerations

- GORM CLI is a local CLI tool and works offline once installed.
- Firewall or proxy configurations do not impact its operation unless they interfere with your Go environment.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">
Ensure you are running Go 1.18 or above:

```bash
go version
```

If Go is older, download and install the latest version from https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GORM CLI Not Found After Installation">
Verify your Go bin directory is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` or your GOBIN to PATH if missing.

Try reinstalling:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Project Layout Probleme">
Make sure your interfaces with SQL templates are in the same package or directory as your GORM models to enable seamless generation.

If models and interfaces live in separate packages, you’ll need to generate separately or consolidate your files.

## Summary

This page has prepared you with a clear checklist and practical guidance to verify your environment before installing or using GORM CLI:

- Confirm Go 1.18+ is installed.
- Structure your Go project with models and annotated interfaces colocated.
- Install GORM CLI via Go tools.
- Ensure filesystem permissions and environment variables are correctly set.

Next up, proceed to **Installing GORM CLI** which covers the exact commands and setup steps to install and verify the CLI on your system.
