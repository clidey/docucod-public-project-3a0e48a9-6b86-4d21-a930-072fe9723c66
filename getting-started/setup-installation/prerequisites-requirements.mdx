# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GORM CLI

Before you install and start using GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the essential prerequisites. This preparation guarantees a smooth installation and optimal functioning from the start.

---

## 1. Go Language Version

GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in Go 1.18. Therefore:

- **Minimum required Go version:** 1.18 or later


### Why Go 1.18+?
Generics allow GORM CLI to generate type-safe query APIs and field helpers, enhancing compile-time validation and developer experience.

```bash
go version
# Expected output example: go version go1.20.3 linux/amd64
```

<Tip>
If your Go version is older than 1.18, download and install the latest stable release from the official [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Tip>


## 2. Supported Operating Systems & Platforms

GORM CLI is a Go command-line tool built for portability. It supports all major operating systems where Go 1.18+ is supported, including:

- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- macOS (amd64, arm64/Apple Silicon)
- Windows (amd64)

<Tip>
Cross-compiling to different platforms is possible by setting Go environment variables like `GOOS` and `GOARCH`. Refer to the official Go documentation for cross-compilation guidance.
</Tip>


## 3. Dependencies

GORM CLI has minimal external dependencies beyond the Go toolchain itself:

- **Go Modules:** Your project should use Go modules (`go.mod`) for dependency management.
- **GORM Library:** GORM CLI integrates with the `gorm.io/gorm` package. Ensure GORM is installed in your project if you plan to use the generated code.


## 4. Network & Permissions

GORM CLI installation and usage typically require:

- Outbound internet access to fetch the CLI module using `go install`. This can be restricted in isolated environments.
- Appropriate filesystem permissions to install to `$GOPATH/bin` or your Go binary directory.


## 5. Recommended Environment Setup

- Confirm your `$PATH` includes the Go binaries directory where GORM CLI will be installed (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).
- Use a terminal with UTF-8 encoding and standard POSIX shell on *nix systems or PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows.


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Using Go versions earlier than 1.18 will cause installation or code generation failures.
- Skipping the setup of Go modules or misconfigured `go.mod` can trigger build errors when using generated code.
- Lack of write permissions to installation directories can block CLI installation.

## Quick Checklist

| Requirement                     | Status / Command                        |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Go 1.18+ Installed             | `go version`                          |
| OS Platform Supported          | Linux, macOS, Windows                  |
| Go Modules Enabled (project)  | `go env GO111MODULE` (should be "on") |
| PATH Includes Go Bin Directory | `echo $PATH` (check for `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) |


## Next Steps

After verifying your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Install GORM CLI](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-instructions) guide to install and configure the CLI tool for your projects.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Prerequisite Validation">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Old">

**Symptoms:** `go install` fails or GORM CLI generation errors mention generics or unknown syntax.

**Resolution:** Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or later. Remove old installations if necessary.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Modules Not Enabled">

**Symptoms:** Build or generation functions complain about missing modules or dependencies.

**Resolution:** Enable modules by running `export GO111MODULE=on` or ensure your project has a valid `go.mod`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Binary Directory Not in PATH">

**Symptoms:** Command `gorm` not found after installation.

**Resolution:** Add your Go bin directory to PATH, for example:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Place the command in your shell profile to make permanent.
