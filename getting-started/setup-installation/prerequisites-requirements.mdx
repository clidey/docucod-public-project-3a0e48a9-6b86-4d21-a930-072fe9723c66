# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your development environment to install and run the GORM CLI tool effectively. This page details the minimal system specifications, software dependencies, and platform compatibility to ensure a smooth installation and usage experience.

---

## 1. System Requirements

GORM CLI is designed to be lightweight and fast, targeting Go developers who want to generate type-safe query APIs and model helpers seamlessly.

- **Operating Systems Supported:** 
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows 

- **Hardware:** 
  - Minimum 1 CPU core
  - Minimum 1 GB RAM (2 GB or more recommended for larger projects)
  - At least 100 MB free disk space for binaries and generated code


## 2. Software Dependencies

Successful installation and operation require the following software components:

- **Go Programming Language**
  - Minimum Go version: **1.18** (to support Go generics used internally by GORM CLI)
  - Confirm your Go version by running:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```
  
  If your Go version is older, update to the latest stable release from the official [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).

- **Git** (optional but recommended):
  - For downloading source code or updates from the repository if not installing via `go install`


## 3. Access & Permissions

- Ensure you have a working Go development environment with GOPATH/bin included in your system PATH to access installed CLI binaries from the terminal.
- You must have adequate permissions to install Go binaries globally or locally, depending on your setup.
- Your user should have file system access rights to the directories where you'll place generated code (typically your project workspace).


## 4. Network & Connectivity

- Internet connection is required to download packages via `go install` or `go get` commands.
- Network access to the GitHub repository https://github.com/go-gorm/cli may be needed for cloning source or viewing documentation.


---

## Verify Environment Compatibility

Before proceeding to installation, verify your environment meets all requirements:

```bash
# Check OS and architecture
uname -a

# Check Go version
go version

# Confirm GOPATH/bin is in your PATH
echo $PATH
```

If any requirement is unmet, address it before continuing.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Keep your Go installation updated regularly to maintain compatibility with GORM CLI enhancements.
- Use Go modules for your projects to manage dependencies cleanly when generating and integrating code.
- Use isolated or dedicated Go workspaces for projects using GORM CLI to avoid conflicts.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
If `go version` returns a version earlier than 1.18, you must update Go:

```bash
# Remove older Go version
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

# Download and install latest version
curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Adjust URL for your OS/architecture from the official Go website.

After installation, verify with `go version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GOPATH or PATH Not Set Correctly">
If the `go install` command succeeds but `gorm` is not found:

- Verify GOPATH is set: `echo $GOPATH`
- Verify `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH: `echo $PATH`
- Add this to your shell profile if missing:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Reload your terminal or source your profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Firewall or Network Blocking Downloads">
If you cannot download packages:

- Check proxy settings
- Whitelist GitHub domains
- Use `git clone` manually if needed
- Confirm your internet connection
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Once you confirm your system meets all requirements and dependencies are met, proceed to the [Installing the GORM CLI](../installation-cli) page for detailed installation instructions.

For a quick confirmation of CLI installation, visit the [Quick CLI Validation](../cli-quick-validation) guide.
