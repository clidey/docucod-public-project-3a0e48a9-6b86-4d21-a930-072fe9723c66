# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you install and start using GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements. This page guides you through essential Go version constraints, supported operating systems, and necessary dependencies so you can set up GORM CLI without surprises.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later**. This is mandatory to leverage Go generics, which the CLI uses extensively for generating type-safe query APIs.

- **Verify your Go version:**

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

  - Expected output should show `go1.18` or newer.

- **Upgrade Go if needed:**

  - Visit [Go Download](https://golang.org/dl/) to get the latest stable version.

  <Warning>
  Using Go versions older than 1.18 will cause installation and runtime failures because generics support is missing.
  </Warning>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is designed to run on any OS that supports Go 1.18+, including:

- Linux (any modern distribution)
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Windows (64-bit editions)

No additional OS-specific dependencies or environment variables are needed beyond a working Go installation.


## 3. Required Dependencies

### Go Toolchain

- You must have a correctly installed and configured Go environment.
- Environment variables like `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` should be set per your Go installation best practices.

### Network Access

- Internet connection is required to download GORM CLI using `go install` or similar.
- Access to GitHub or proxy for fetching modules from `gorm.io` and dependencies.

### Additional Software

- No database or external services are required to install or run the CLI tool itself.
- However, to use GORM CLI-generated code effectively, you will need:
  - Access to a supported database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
  - An existing GORM-compatible project

<Info>
Check the database drivers and GORM ORM versions you are using for compatibility when integrating generated code.
</Info>

## 4. Summary Checklist

<Check>
- Go 1.18 or newer installed and verified (`go version`)
- Supported OS (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- Internet access for installation
- Working Go environment (`GOPATH`, `GOROOT` configured)
- Access to your project's GORM ORM and database for generated code usage
</Check>

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Guide">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">

- **Symptom:** `go install` fails with error about generics or unsupported Go version.
- **Cause:** Go version is below 1.18.
- **Resolution:** Update Go to 1.18 or later.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Access Problems">

- **Symptom:** Unable to `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` due to timeout or DNS issues.
- **Cause:** Network blocks or proxy misconfigurations.
- **Resolution:** Check your internet connection, configure Go proxy with `GOPROXY`, or consult network admin.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment Variables Misconfigured">

- **Symptom:** Go commands working, but CLI execution or compilation fails.
- **Cause:** Incorrect `GOPATH`, `GOROOT` or PATH variables.
- **Resolution:** Ensure your shell environment exports these variables correctly. Run `go env` to verify current settings.

</Accordion>

## Practical Tips

- **Installation First Step:** Confirm Go version before any install attempts.
- **Workspace Cleanliness:** Maintain separate Go module-aware project directories to avoid dependency conflicts.
- **Version Pinning:** Consider pinning GORM CLI version in your build scripts for stable reproducible builds.

## Next Steps

Once your environment meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installing GORM CLI](../cli-installation) guide to install the CLI tool and prepare for your first generation run.
