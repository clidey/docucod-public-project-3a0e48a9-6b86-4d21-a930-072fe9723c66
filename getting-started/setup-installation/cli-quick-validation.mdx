# Quick CLI Validation

Ensure your GORM CLI installation is successful and your environment is correctly configured by running basic commands and checking the CLI version. This guide helps you confirm that the CLI tool is operational before moving on to code generation.

---

## 1. Verify CLI Version

After installing the GORM CLI, the first step is to confirm the installed version and that the CLI is accessible from your command line.

### Steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
gorm version
```

3. You should see output similar to:

```
GORM CLI version x.y.z
```

This output confirms that the CLI is installed and runnable. If you see a command not found or similar error, verify that your `GOPATH/bin` or your Go installation bin directory is included in your system's PATH.

---

## 2. Run the Help Command

The CLI provides a concise help menu that lists available commands and options.

### Steps:

1. Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

2. Review the displayed command summary to ensure commands like `gen` (code generation) are available.

Example snippet of expected output:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

---

## 3. Validate Environment Setup

The CLI requires Go 1.18 or later and correct environment variables.

### Check Go Version:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

Ensure the version shown is 1.18 or higher.

### Check GOPATH and PATH:

Verify your Go bin directory is in your `PATH`.

```bash
echo $GOPATH
```

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If `GOPATH/bin` or your Go installation's bin folder is not listed, add it.

---

## 4. Run a Basic Command to Confirm Functionality

A simple command to confirm that the CLI is working without errors is the version or help commands shown above. For further confirmation, if you have a sample interface file and workspace, try running the generator with a dry run or minimal input (if applicable).

Example command to list generation flags:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

This should display the usage for the `gen` command with flags such as `--input` and `--output`.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found">
If running `gorm` returns 'command not found':
- Ensure Go binaries are installed.
- Add `$GOPATH/bin` or the Golang binary directory to your system PATH.
- Restart your terminal after modifying environment variables.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
The CLI requires at least Go 1.18 for generic support.
- Update Go to 1.18 or later from the official https://golang.org/dl/
- Verify with `go version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied on Execution">
- Check that the `gorm` binary has execution permissions.
- On Unix systems, run:

```bash
chmod +x $(which gorm)
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Output or Errors">
- Verify that your shell environment points to the correct binary.
- Reinstall the CLI using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
- Confirm by checking the installed binary location with `which gorm`.
</Accordion>

## Next Steps

Now that your GORM CLI is validated and working:

- Proceed to [Preparing Models & Query Interfaces](/getting-started/first-codegen-workflow/prepare-models-interfaces) to define interfaces and models.
- Follow [Running the Code Generator](/getting-started/first-codegen-workflow/generate-code) for generating code from your definitions.
- See [Using the Generated APIs](/getting-started/first-codegen-workflow/using-generated-code) to integrate generated code into your projects.
