# Installing GORM CLI

Follow this step-by-step guide to install the GORM CLI tool using `go install`. Whether you are on Linux, macOS, or Windows, this guide will help you get the CLI installed and ready for your first code generation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing, ensure your environment meets these criteria:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or higher. This is required due to the use of generics in the CLI.
- **Operating System**: Supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Go Environment Setup**: The Go toolchain (`go` command) must be properly installed and available in your system's `PATH`.
- **Network Access**: Required to fetch the CLI package from the module proxy or GitHub.

<Tip>
Verify your Go installation and version with:

```bash
go version
```
Ensure the output shows Go 1.18 or newer.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

The official and recommended way to install GORM CLI is via the `go install` command which installs the CLI binary to your Go binaries directory.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the installation command">
Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads and builds the latest stable version of GORM CLI.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the installation">
Once installed, confirm the CLI is available and check its version:

```bash
gorm version
```

A successful install will output the installed version number.
</Step>

<Step title="Ensure Go binary path is in your PATH">
Make sure your Go binaries directory is part of your system's `PATH` environment variable. This is typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

- On Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\\bin"
```

Adjust the command to your shell or system configuration if necessary.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you encounter a "command not found" after installation, this usually means your `PATH` does not include the Go binaries directory. Adding it as shown above resolves this.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

- **macOS/Linux**: The Go environment is typically set up by default with the binaries installed into `$HOME/go/bin`. Ensure this is in your `PATH`.

- **Windows**: Go binaries default to `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`. Verify that this path is included in your system environment variables.

<Warning>
On Windows, if multiple terminals or shells are in use, add Go's bin path to the system (not just user) environment variables for consistent access.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Verifying Your Installation

After running the install and setting your path, test the CLI functionality:

```bash
gorm help
```

You should see the CLI usage information, including commands such as `gen` for generation.

<Tip>
If `gorm help` works, your installation is successful and you’re ready to start generating code.
</Tip>

Try to run a version check:

```bash
gorm --version
```

or

```bash
gorm version
```

depending on your shell capabilities.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Go version is too low or not installed">
Check your Go version with `go version`. Ensure it is 1.18 or higher. If not, download the latest Go release from the official site https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'gorm' command not found after install">
Check if your `GOPATH/bin` or `go env GOPATH` & `bin` folder is in your system's `PATH` environment variable. Refer to step 2 above for path setup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network issues when running 'go install'">
Ensure you have internet connectivity and your Go proxy is accessible. If behind a proxy or firewall, configure Go proxy or network settings accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied errors on Unix/Linux/macOS">
Run the install command using appropriate user permissions. Avoid using `sudo` with `go install`. Set permissions for your `$GOPATH` directory correctly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
