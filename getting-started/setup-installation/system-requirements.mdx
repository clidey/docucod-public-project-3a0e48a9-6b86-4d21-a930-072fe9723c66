# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment is properly prepared before installing and using GORM CLI. Meeting these prerequisites guarantees a smooth setup and prevents common issues.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is compatible with all operating systems supported by Go 1.18 and later, including but not limited to:

- Linux (various distributions)
- macOS
- Windows

Since GORM CLI is a Go command-line tool, wherever Go 1.18+ runs, GORM CLI will run seamlessly.


## 2. Go Version Requirement

- **Minimum Go Version:** Go 1.18 or later

GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in Go 1.18. Using any earlier Go version will result in build failures or runtime errors.

Check your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, update Go before continuing.


## 3. Development Environment Prerequisites

- **Go Modules Enabled:** GORM CLI assumes you are using Go modules to manage dependencies.
- **GORM ORM Library:** While direct installation is not mandatory here, integrating with `gorm.io/gorm` is required for generated code usage.


## 4. Hardware & Resource Requirements

- **Memory & CPU:** Any modern development machine capable of running Go 1.18+ smoothly.
- **Disk Space:** 
  - Minimal for the CLI tool (few MBs)
  - Additional space depends on your project and generated code, typically small.


## 5. Network Requirements

- Internet access is required for:
  - Installing Go and dependencies
  - Installing GORM CLI via `go install`
  - Accessing your source repositories and external modules

Ensure no firewall or proxy blocks access to the Go module proxy or GitHub.


## 6. Account and Permissions

- **User permissions:** 
  - Ability to install Go binaries on your machine.
  - Permission to read/write your project directory where code generation will output.


## 7. Common Compatibility Notes

- GORM CLI does **not** require a live database connection during code generation.
- The generated code works with any GORM-supported database.


---

## Verification Example

1. Verify Go installation:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

2. Verify GORM CLI installation command is ready to run:

```bash
# Install latest version
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Requirements">
<Accordion title="Go Version is below 1.18">
Run `go version` to check your version. Visit https://golang.org/dl/ to download and install Go 1.18 or later. Ensure your PATH environment variable points to the updated Go binary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Installing Binaries">
Make sure you have write permission to your Go binaries directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin`). Use `sudo` or adjust permissions if required.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Issues during Installation">
Confirm firewall and proxy settings allow outbound HTTPS to the Go module proxy (`proxy.golang.org`) and GitHub.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Once your environment meets these system requirements, proceed to the [Installing GORM CLI](./installing-gorm-cli) guide to install and verify GORM CLI on your system.

To deepen understanding of how the tool works and how to integrate with your project, review the [Architecture Overview](../../overview/concepts-architecture-flow/architecture-overview) and [Integration with GORM](../../overview/concepts-architecture-flow/integration-points) documentation.
