# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page helps you quickly diagnose and fix typical problems encountered during GORM CLI setup and usage. Whether you face environment path errors, Go version mismatches, or file permission problems, this guide provides actionable solutions and troubleshooting advice to get you back on track efficiently.

---

## 1. Environment PATH Issues

Sometimes after installing GORM CLI, the command may not be recognized or found. This usually means the Go binaries directory is not included in your system's PATH environment variable.

### How to Verify

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run:

```bash
which gorm
# or on Windows
where gorm
```

3. If no path is returned, GORM CLI is not on your PATH.

### Immediate Fix

- Ensure Goâ€™s bin directory is included in your PATH:

  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```
    Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)

  - On Windows:
    - Add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` to your system environment variables PATH.

- Restart your terminal after updating PATH.

### Verify Again

Run:

```bash
gorm version
```

If you see version info, the PATH is correctly configured.

<Note>
If you installed GORM CLI without Go modules setup or used a different install command, the binary may be located elsewhere. Use `go env GOPATH` to find the correct bin directory.
</Note>

---

## 2. Go Version Mismatch

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or newer** due to its use of generics and modern language features.

### Check Your Go Version

Run:

```bash
go version
```

If your version is less than 1.18, upgrade Go following the official installation guide: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### Common Symptoms

- `go install` fails with errors about generics or unsupported syntax
- Compilation errors referencing generics or type parameters

### Resolution

- Upgrade to Go 1.18+
- Verify Go environment (see [Go environment variables](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Environment_variables)) is not overriding Go root or path

<Warning>
Running an older Go version is the most frequent cause of installation and build failures. Confirm and upgrade before troubleshooting other issues.
</Warning>

## 3. Permission or Executable Problems

On Unix-based systems, the `gorm` binary must have executable permissions.

### Verify Executable Permission

Run:

```bash
ls -l $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```

You should see executable bits set (e.g., `-rwxr-xr-x`).

### Fix Permissions

If missing, run:

```bash
chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```

### Windows Execution Issues

- Ensure the executable is not blocked by antivirus or Windows Defender.
- Run the command prompt or PowerShell as administrator if needed.

<Info>
Permission errors can also arise if you install or run GORM CLI in directories with restrictive policies. Use standard user directories to avoid this.
</Info>

## 4. Installation Failures

Common issues during `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`:

- Network problems or proxy misconfiguration
- Module version conflicts or caching corruption

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. Clear Go build cache:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

2. Verify your network and proxy settings:

```bash
go env | grep -i proxy
```

3. Use verbose mode to get detailed logs:

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go install -v gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

4. If pulling from GitHub fails, try manually cloning the repo or check GitHub availability.

<Note>
Ensure your Go environment variables such as `GOPROXY` are set to public proxy services like `https://proxy.golang.org` unless corporate policies require alternatives.
</Note>

## 5. Errors Running the CLI

### Common Errors

- `command not found` or `executable file not found in $PATH`
- `permission denied`
- Version mismatch errors

### Quick Checks

- Confirm `gorm` is installed and on PATH (`which gorm`)
- Confirm correct Go version (`go version`)
- Check executable permissions
- Run `gorm help` to verify CLI responds

<Warning>
If `gorm` command executes but subcommands fail, verify you are running the latest version and that your project code is compatible.
</Warning>

## Summary

Following this guide will resolve the majority of common setup issues. If problems persist after verifying PATH, Go version, and permissions, consider:

- Reviewing the installation logs for specific errors
- Consulting the GORM CLI GitHub issues for similar problems
- Asking for help on community forums or GORM support channels

Remember, correct Go installation and PATH setup are the foundation required for smooth GORM CLI operation.

<Check>
**Before you continue:**

- `gorm` command runs and responds to `gorm help`
- Your Go version is 1.18 or higher
- Go bin directory is in your PATH environment
- `gorm` binary has executable permissions
</Check>
