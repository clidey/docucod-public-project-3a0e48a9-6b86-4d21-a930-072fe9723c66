# Installation Instructions for GORM CLI

This guide provides clear, actionable steps to install the GORM CLI tool across supported platforms using the official Go tooling. Follow the platform-specific instructions and best practices to quickly and reliably get the CLI installed and ready for your Go projects.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Go version:** Go 1.18 or higher is required, as GORM CLI leverages Go generics.
- **Network connectivity:** You must have internet access to download modules and the CLI.
- **Go environment setup:** Your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables should be set, or use the default Go workspace.

<Check>
Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```
The output should show `go version go1.18` or higher.
</Check>

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module and installed using `go install`. This ensures you get the latest stable version with minimal overhead.

### Step-by-step install command

Open your terminal and execute the following:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This downloads, compiles, and installs the binary into your `GOBIN` directory.

### Verify Installation

After installation, confirm it is available by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output displays the CLI usage summary:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## 3. Platform-Specific Guidance

### For Linux/macOS

- Ensure `$GOBIN` is in your `PATH`. Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- Reload your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or equivalent).

### For Windows

- The binary will be installed to `%GOPATH%\bin` by default.
- Add this folder to your system PATH via Environment Variables settings.
- You can verify by running `where gorm` in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

---

## 4. Common Troubleshooting

<Tip>
If `go install` fails or the command `gorm` is not found after installation:
- Ensure Go is properly installed and on your system path.
- Check your `GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your shell's PATH environment variable.
- Confirm your Go proxy settings (`GOPROXY`) allow fetching modules.
- Run `go env` to inspect environment variables related to Go modules and paths.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid downloading GORM CLI binaries from unofficial sources to prevent security risks.
Always install through the official Go module proxy and repository.
</Warning>

## 5. Next Steps

Now that GORM CLI is installed:

- Proceed to [Define Models & Query Interfaces](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/first-generation/define-models-interfaces) to create Go code for your database models and interface queries.
- Follow [Run the Code Generator](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/first-generation/run-code-generator) for generating type-safe query APIs.
- Explore [Validate Generated APIs](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/first-generation/validate-generated-apis) to integrate and test the generated code.
