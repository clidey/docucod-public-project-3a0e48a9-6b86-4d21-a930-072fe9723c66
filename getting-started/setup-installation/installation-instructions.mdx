# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

This guide walks you through the step-by-step installation process of the GORM CLI tool across supported platforms, ensuring a stable and compatible setup through Go modules.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, verify the following prerequisites to ensure a smooth setup:

- **Go Version**: Must have Go 1.18 or above installed, as GORM CLI depends on Go generics.
- **Platform Support**: GORM CLI supports all major platforms where Go runs (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Access**: Ensure that your environment can access public Go package repositories.
- **Network**: No special firewall or port requirements; standard internet connectivity to `proxy.golang.org` or fallback module sources.

<Tip>
If you do not have Go installed, download and install it from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Using Go Modules (Recommended)

The most reliable and recommended way to install GORM CLI is via `go install` which respects module versioning.

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# Install the latest release of GORM CLI
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads, builds, and installs the `gorm` CLI binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory.

### Verifying the Installation

After installation completes successfully:

1. Ensure that your Go bin directory is in your system's `PATH`.

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   # or for Windows
   echo %PATH%
   ```

2. Run the CLI tool to confirm:

   ```bash
   gorm --help
   ```

   You should see the GORM CLI usage output with the available commands including `gen`.

## 3. Best Practices for Installation

- **Version Pinning**: Instead of `@latest`, pin to a specific released version to maintain reproducibility, e.g.: 

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v1.5.0
  ```

- **Avoid Global Installs in Containers**: For containerized environments, prefer adding GORM CLI as a build dependency within module-aware builds.
- **Use Go Modules**: Always use Go 1.18+ with modules enabled (`GO111MODULE=on`) to prevent versioning conflicts.

---

## 4. Alternative Installation Methods

Currently, GORM CLI distributes only via Go modules. It does not provide standalone binaries, package manager formulas, or Docker images.

If you require manual builds:

1. Clone the official repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.git
   cd cli
   ```

2. Build manually:

   ```bash
   go build -o gorm ./gorm
   ```

3. Move the `gorm` binary to a directory included in your `PATH`.

<Tip>
Manual builds require Go 1.18+ installed on your system.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Post-Installation Verification

Confirm that the GORM CLI tool is both installed and functioning:

1. Check installed binary version & help:

   ```bash
   gorm --version
   gorm --help
   ```

2. Run a simple code generation test (if you have existing Go code for interfaces/models):

   ```bash
   gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
   ```

3. Verify the output directory contains generated code with typed query APIs and field helpers.

<Check>
If `gorm gen` fails, check your Go environment, your project's module setup, and ensure your input path exists and contains properly annotated Go interfaces.
</Check>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Verify your Go bin directory is in your system's PATH. The binary is typically installed to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.

Add to PATH temporarily:

```bash
export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
```

For permanent fix, add that to your shell profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version Mismatch or Build Errors">
Ensure your Go version is 1.18 or higher.

Check via:

```bash
go version
```

Upgrade Go if necessary to meet this requirement.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues">
If `go install` fails due to network or proxy errors, verify:

- Internet connectivity
- GOPROXY environment variable settings

You can set GOPROXY to direct or a valid proxy:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

</Accordion>

## 7. Next Steps

With GORM CLI installed:

- Proceed to [Your First Code Generation](/getting-started/first-run-configuration/your-first-generate) to create type-safe query APIs.
- Explore [Basic Configuration](/getting-started/first-run-configuration/basic-configuration) to customize generation outputs.
- Review [Quick Validation & Smoke Test](/getting-started/setup-installation/quick-validation) to confirm everything works end to end.

For deeper integration and advanced usage, consult the [Overview: Feature Highlights](/overview/getting-started-core/overview-feature-quicklook) and [System Architecture Overview](/overview/system-architecture-concepts/architecture-overview) pages.
