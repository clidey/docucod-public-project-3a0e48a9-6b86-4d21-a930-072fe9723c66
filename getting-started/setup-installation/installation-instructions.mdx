# Install GORM CLI

This page provides you with platform-agnostic, practical steps to install the GORM CLI tool quickly using simple `go install` commands. It guides you through acquiring the CLI binary, verifying its installation, and ensuring it is readily available from your command line.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before beginning installation, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version:** 1.18 or higher (generics support is mandatory).
- **Operating Systems:** Supports Linux, macOS, Windows (via compatible Go toolchain).
- **Environment:** Go environment properly configured, including `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` settings.

If you haven't installed Go yet, download it from the official site: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

<Tip>
Run `go version` in your terminal to confirm your Go installation and version.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Steps

The recommended method to install GORM CLI is using the `go install` command, which fetches the latest published version and puts the CLI executable in your Go bin directory.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the installation command">
Execute the following in your terminal:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This installs the `gorm` CLI binary.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Go bin directory in your PATH">
Make sure your Go binary directory is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

- Default Go bin location is typically `$GOPATH/bin` or, if GOPATH is not explicitly set, `$HOME/go/bin`.

- On Unix-like systems, you can check by running:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

- If Go bin is missing, add it by updating your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Then, reload your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc`.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm CLI installation">
Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output should display the current CLI version (e.g., `gorm version vX.Y.Z`).

If you see a "command not found" error, revisit Step 2 to ensure the binary path is on your PATH.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Avoid manually downloading binaries from unverified sources. Always use `go install` to ensure you receive the latest official release.
</Warning>

## 3. Post-Installation Verification

Once installed, performing a simple verification confirms the CLI is functional.

### Check installed executable path

Run:

```bash
which gorm
```

(or `where gorm` on Windows)

This should return the full file path of the `gorm` binary.

### Test CLI help output

Use:

```bash
gorm --help
```

A successful install will show CLI usage information and available commands.

<Tip>
If your shell does not recognize `gorm` immediately after install, restart your terminal session or run `hash -r` (Unix).
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="'gorm' command not found after installation">
- Confirm that Go's bin directory is in your PATH.
- Run `echo $PATH` and confirm presence of Go bin path.
- Restart terminal or run `source` on your profile.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
- Update Go to at least version 1.18.
- Check your installed version with `go version`.
- Download from https://golang.org/dl/ if outdated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Installation fails due to network or proxy issues">
- Check your internet connection.
- Configure HTTP proxy settings if behind corporate firewall.
- Retry the install command.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied when running 'go install'">
- Ensure your user has write permissions to `$GOPATH/bin`.
- Avoid using sudo with `go install`.
- Fix permissions or consult your system administrator.
</Accordion>

## 5. Next Steps

After installing the CLI successfully:

- Proceed to define your Go interfaces and models for your GORM project.
- Visit the [Quick Start: Your First Code Generation](/getting-started/first-steps/quickstart-basic-usage) guide to generate type-safe query APIs from your interfaces.
- Refer to [Validate Your Installation](/getting-started/setup-installation/validate-installation) for advanced verification.

See also the broader [Setup & Installation](../../getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-requirements) documentation to ensure your environment is optimized for GORM CLI usage.

## 6. Summary

Installing GORM CLI is a straightforward process leveraging Go's built-in toolchain. Running just:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

installs the CLI tool cross-platform. Verifying the binary and your path ensure smooth command-line access to start generating your GORM query APIs rapidly.
