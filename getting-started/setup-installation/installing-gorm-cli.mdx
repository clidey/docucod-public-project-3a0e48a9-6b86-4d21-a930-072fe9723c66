# Installing GORM CLI

GORM CLI is a powerful command-line tool designed to generate type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-based field helpers for your GORM-based Go projects. Installing GORM CLI is straightforward using Go's built-in package management, ensuring you get the latest version quickly and reliably.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version:** 1.18 or higher (required for generics support)
- **Supported OS:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Go environment:** Your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` should be properly set up for Go module support
- **Network access:** Ability to download packages from the internet (for `go install`)

<Tip>
Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, please update to the latest release before proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install the latest version of GORM CLI:

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the Install Command">
Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads, builds, and installs the `gorm` binary into your Go bin directory (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin`).

<Check>
Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin` by default) is included in your system `PATH` variable to run the `gorm` command globally.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the Installation">
Confirm that GORM CLI is installed and accessible:

```bash
gorm --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
GORM CLI version x.y.z
```

If you see an error like `command not found`, check your PATH setup and retry Step 1.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 3. Post-Installation Validation

Run a quick command to see the help menu and confirm the CLI is functional:

```bash
gorm --help
```

This displays all available commands and options. For example, the `gen` command is used to generate code from your interfaces.

<Tip>
On some systems, you may need to restart your terminal or source your shell profile file for PATH changes to take effect.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI command not found after installation">
If running `gorm` gives a 'command not found' error:

- Confirm `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your PATH environment variable.
- Check where Go installed binaries:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

- Add the bin directory to PATH if missing, e.g.,

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
- Restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is too old">
You must have Go 1.18 or above.

- Check your version:

```bash
go version
```

- Upgrade Go via your OS package manager or download the latest from https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network or module download issues">
- Ensure your firewall or proxy allows access to Go module mirrors.
- Try setting environment variables for module proxy:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

- Retry the install command.
</Accordion>
