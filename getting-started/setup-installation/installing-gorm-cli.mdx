# Installing GORM CLI

This guide walks you through the clear, actionable steps to install the **GORM CLI** tool on your development machine. GORM CLI is a code generator for Go that creates type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers compatible with GORM. By following these instructions, you will have GORM CLI ready to generate your first code with confidence.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version:** You must have Go 1.18 or newer installed to support generics, which GORM CLI relies on.
- **Environment Setup:** Your `GOPATH` and `PATH` environment variables should include the Go binary directory to use `go install` and run installed CLI tools.

### Verify Go Installation
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output example:

```
go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64
```

If Go is not installed or outdated, [download and install Go](https://golang.org/dl/) first.

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI
The recommended installation method uses the `go install` command, which retrieves and installs the latest published version of the GORM CLI tool.

### Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the installation command">
Execute the following to install the latest GORM CLI binary:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This installs the `gorm` binary to your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).
</Step>
<Step title="Add Go bin directory to your PATH">
Make sure the Go bin directory is included in your system `PATH` so you can run `gorm` globally.

- For Unix/macOS (bash/zsh): Add the following to your shell profile (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- For Windows (PowerShell):

  ```powershell
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $Env:Path + ";" + (go env GOPATH) + '\bin', [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
  ```

Restart your terminal after updating your PATH.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate the installation">
Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the help output describing the commands and flags available.

If the command is not found, verify PATH settings and that the binary exists in your Go bin directory.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Installing via `go install` ensures you get the latest stable release. You can also specify a version tag, e.g., `gorm@vX.Y.Z`, for reproducible builds.
</Tip>

## 3. Platform Considerations

GORM CLI is cross-platform and works on major OSes where Go runs: Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### macOS / Linux
- Ensure you have at least Go 1.18 installed.
- Use the shell commands above to set your PATH.

### Windows
- Use PowerShell or Windows Terminal.
- Update your user environment variables to include Go's bin directory.
- If using Git Bash or WSL, configure accordingly.

<Warning>
On Windows, running the command prompt as Administrator is sometimes needed if permission issues occur during installation or PATH updates.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Verifying Your Setup
Ensure GORM CLI is installed and functional by following these verification steps:

1. **Confirm `gorm` binary is accessible:**

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output confirms the tool version (if implemented). If no version command is present, at least ensure `--help` works.

2. **Test running the generator command:**

Prepare a small Go interface file with SQL templates (see examples in the documentation) and run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

This should process your interfaces and output generated code without errors.

3. **Check generated files:**

Look inside the output directory to verify the generated Go files appear as expected.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation and Setup Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="`gorm` command not found after installation">
- Ensure your Go bin directory (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) is in your `PATH` environment variable.
- Restart your terminal or log out and back in to refresh environment variables.
- Confirm binary exists: `ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm` or equivalent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied during `go install`">
- Check your system permissions or run with elevated privileges if necessary.
- Clear Go module cache (`go clean -modcache`) and retry.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version incompatible error">
- Confirm you are running Go 1.18 or later.
- Update your Go installation from <https://golang.org/dl/>.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output directory not created or empty after generation">
- Verify the `-o` output directory path is correct and writable.
- Confirm your input path with `-i` points to valid Go interfaces with SQL comments.
- Check error messages for parsing issues in your interfaces.
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps

With GORM CLI installed and validated, you are ready to:

- Define query interfaces with SQL templates in your application package.
- Generate type-safe query APIs and field helpers using `gorm gen`.
- Integrate generated code seamlessly into your GORM project for safe, efficient database access.
