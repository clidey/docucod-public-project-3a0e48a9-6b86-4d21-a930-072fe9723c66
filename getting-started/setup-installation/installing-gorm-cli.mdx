# Installing GORM CLI

Welcome to the gateway of your journey with GORM CLI! This guide delivers a straightforward, step-by-step approach to installing the GORM Command Line Interface (CLI) tool across all major platforms in Go environments. By the end, you will have the CLI ready to generate type-safe code that integrates seamlessly with your Go applications.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Go Version**: GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later**. This is essential for generics support which GORM CLI leverages.
- **Operating System Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux — any OS compatible with Go tooling.
- **Go Environment Setup**: Ensure your GOPATH and GOBIN environment variables are configured if you rely on them, so the installed binaries are accessible.

<Tip>
If you do not have Go installed, download it from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/ and follow the installation instructions tailored for your OS.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

The recommended and preferred way to install the GORM CLI is using Go's `go install` command. This ensures you get the latest release and have the CLI tool available globally.

### Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your terminal or command prompt">
Launch your CLI interface on your OS — Terminal on macOS/Linux, PowerShell or Command Prompt on Windows.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the installation command">
Paste and execute the following command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads and builds the GORM CLI from the latest stable source for your Go environment.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the CLI binary installation">
Confirm that the `gorm` binary is installed and accessible:

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see output indicating the version of GORM CLI installed.

If you see a "command not found" error, ensure your Go bin directory is added to your PATH environment variable:

- On Unix-like systems: Add `export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"` to your shell profile.
- On Windows: Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your system PATH.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Instead of `@latest`, you can specify a particular version by replacing `latest` with the version tag, for example `gorm.io/cli/gorm@v1.2.3`.
</Note>

### Alternative Installation Options

Currently, the `go install` method is the officially supported and recommended installation process. No standalone binaries or packages are provided, emphasizing Go's ecosystem best practices.

---

## 3. Configuration & Setup

After installation, no additional configuration is required to start using the CLI. However, to generate code successfully, you will need:

- A Go project with your model structs and SQL query interfaces defined.
- Proper Go module initialization (`go mod init`) in your project.

You can optionally create a `genconfig.Config` in your Go files to customize output directories or field mapping, but this is not mandatory for installation.

---

## 4. Running Your First GORM CLI Operation

Once installed, you can use GORM CLI to generate type-safe code from your interfaces and models.

### Example: Generating Code From Query Interfaces

Assuming you have defined a query interface and model structs in your project (e.g., in the `./examples` directory), run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` flag specifies the input path where your interfaces and models live.
- `-o` flag specifies the output directory for the generated code.

### Confirm Output

After running the command, check that the `./generated` directory contains Go files with the generated query API and field helpers.

<Check>
A successful run prints a message like:

```
Generating file ./generated/query_gen.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

This indicates that the code was generated without errors.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation">
<Accordion title="'gorm' command not found after installation">
Make sure your Go bin directory is part of your system PATH:

- Run `go env GOPATH` to find your Go workspace path.
- The binaries are located in `GOPATH/bin`.
- Add this folder to PATH:

  - For Linux/macOS: `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
  - For Windows: Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to System Environment Variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
GORM CLI requires Go version 1.18 or higher for generics support.

Run `go version` to check your Go version.

If outdated, upgrade to the latest Go release at https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network or proxy errors during 'go install'">
Confirm you have internet connectivity and that your Go proxy settings allow fetching external modules.

You can set GOPROXY to `https://proxy.golang.org,direct` or `direct` if behind a firewall:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps

- Explore writing your first query interface with SQL templates and your model structs.
- Run `gorm gen` to generate strongly typed query interfaces and field helpers.
- Visit [Initialize Your Project](../first-steps/initialize-your-project) and [Generate Type-Safe Code](../first-steps/generate-code) guides to continue your onboarding.
