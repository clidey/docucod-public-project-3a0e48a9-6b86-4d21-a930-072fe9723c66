# Installing GORM CLI

Follow these streamlined instructions to install the GORM CLI tool on your system. This guide covers installation steps, validation of the setup, and troubleshooting common issues to ensure you can start generating type-safe GORM APIs with ease.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, verify your environment meets these requirements:

- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or higher (required for generics support)
- **Supported Platforms:** All major OS supported by Go compiler (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Network Access:** Internet access to download the binary using `go install`
- **Permissions:** Access to install Go binaries in your system’s `$GOPATH/bin` or equivalent

<Tip>
If you haven’t installed Go yet, download it from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/

Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` directory is included in your system `$PATH` for command-line access to `gorm`.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

You will install the official GORM CLI tool using Go's module-aware install command.

### Step 1: Install the GORM CLI Binary

Run the following command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches the latest release of `gorm` CLI and installs it in your Go binary directory.

### Step 2: Verify the Installation

After installation, verify that the CLI is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```
You should see a help message describing the available commands.

### Step 3: Set Your PATH (if needed)

If running `gorm` returns "command not found", ensure your Go binary install directory is in your PATH. For example:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence.

---

## 3. Validating the Installation

Confirm that the GORM CLI tool works correctly by generating code from example queries.

### Example Generation Command

Create a directory `examples/` with an interface file defining your SQL queries (see `examples/query.go` in the repository for reference).

Run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

This command uses the `gen` subcommand to process your interface files and output generated Go source code.

<Tip>
Use the `-i` flag to specify the input directory or file containing Go interfaces with SQL templates.
Use the `-o` flag to define where generated files will be placed.
</Tip>

### Expected Outcome

```
Generating file generated/query.go from examples/query.go...
```

This confirms the CLI processed the inputs and wrote generated code.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI command not found after install">
Check that your Go binary directory is in your system PATH.

- Run `go env GOPATH` and verify you have `${GOPATH}/bin` in your PATH.
- Add to PATH if missing (see setup in Step 3 above).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version too low to use GORM CLI">
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ for generics support.

- Run `go version` to check your version.
- Upgrade Go to the latest stable release from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied during installation">
If you see permission errors installing the binary:

- Ensure you have write access to your Go bin directory (often `$GOPATH/bin`).
- Run the install command with appropriate privileges or configure Go to install binaries in a user-writable directory.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network errors fetching package">
Confirm your internet connection is stable.
If behind a proxy or firewall, ensure Go module proxy settings and firewall rules allow `go install` to fetch packages.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verifying generated code compilation errors">
If the generated code does not compile:

- Ensure your input Go files have valid SQL templates in comments.
- Check the config files if you are using custom generation configurations.
- Review the CLI error output for hints on missing imports or incorrect query definitions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps & Getting Help

Now that you have installed and validated GORM CLI:

- Explore [Basic Configuration](./initial-configuration) to customize generation behavior.
- Try [Your First Code Generation](./your-first-generation) to generate APIs from your own interfaces.
- Learn how to [Use Generated APIs](./validating-usage) to integrate generated code with your GORM models.

For issues or advanced usage, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](./troubleshooting-install) guide and the official repository issues page.
