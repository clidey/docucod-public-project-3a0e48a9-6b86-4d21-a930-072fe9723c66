# Installing GORM CLI

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool on your system using various methods tailored for different environments. It covers environment preparation, installation commands, and how to verify that the CLI is installed and ready for use.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Environment Preparation

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or higher is required, due to generics usage.
- **Go Environment Setup**: Your `GOPATH` and Go tooling must be properly installed and configured.
- **Network Access**: Your machine should have internet access to download modules/packages.

<Tip>
If you haven’t installed Go or need to upgrade, visit the official Go download page: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Methods

You can install GORM CLI via the official Go module installation command or build it from source.

### 2.1 Install Using `go install`

This is the recommended, simplest way to get the latest version of GORM CLI installed globally:

```bash
# Installs the latest version into your $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN
# Ensure $GOPATH/bin is in your $PATH environment variable

go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### 2.2 Verify Go Binary Path

Make sure your Go binary path is included in your shell PATH variable so that `gorm` is accessible globally:

```bash
# For Bash or Zsh
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"

# Verify
which gorm
```

If you see a path printed, the CLI is accessible on your command line.

### 2.3 Build From Source (Optional)

Follow these steps if you prefer building the CLI manually:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.git
cd cli
```

2. Build the CLI binary:

```bash
# Build the main gorm CLI tool
GO111MODULE=on go build -o gorm ./gorm
```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
mv gorm /usr/local/bin/ # or another folder in your PATH
```

<Tip>
Building from source lets you customize or debug the CLI but requires Go tooling knowledge.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Verify Your Installation

After installation completes, verify that the tool is installed and working correctly.

### 3.1 Check Version

Run the version command:

```bash
gorm --version
```

Expected output should show the CLI version, for example:

```
gorm version vX.Y.Z
```

### 3.2 Run Help Command

Confirm CLI commands are accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

This displays usage information and commands like `gen` for code generation.

<Tip>
If you encounter "command not found" errors, ensure your GOPATH/bin is added to your PATH or your binary location is correct.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Environment Variables and Configuration

While no environment variables are strictly required to run GORM CLI, consider these tips:

- Make sure your database connection strings or DSNs are securely stored outside the CLI, usually in your application or environment configuration.
- The CLI uses flags like `-i` for input and `-o` for output directory during generation commands.

<Note>
The CLI does not require persistent environment variables for installation or execution but relies on proper Go environment setup.
</Note>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Missing or Outdated Go Version">
Ensure you have Go 1.18 or later installed.

```bash
go version
```
If outdated, upgrade Go via the official website.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Check that your Go binary path is in your system PATH.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
which gorm
```
Restart your terminal after setting PATH.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Issues Installing the Binary">
When moving or executing binaries, use appropriate permissions. On Unix-based systems:

```bash
sudo mv gorm /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gorm
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Errors During `go install`">
Check your network connectivity or configure Go proxy settings:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that GORM CLI is installed, proceed to:

- [Quickstart: Your First Workflow](../project-configuration-run/quickstart-overview) — configure and run your first code generation.
- [Basic Configuration & Structure](../project-configuration-run/basic-config-setup) — understand how to structure your project for GORM CLI.
- [Running Code Generation](../project-configuration-run/generation-cli-commands) — use the CLI to generate type-safe query code.

<Info>
Explore the [Prerequisites & Requirements](../setup-installation/prerequisites-requirements) page if you encounter environment setup issues before installation.

## Appendix: Quick Installation Reference

```bash
# Install latest version
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Add Go bin to PATH (if necessary)
 export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"

# Verify version
 gorm --version

# Get help
 gorm --help
```
