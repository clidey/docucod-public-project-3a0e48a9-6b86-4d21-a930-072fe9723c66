# Validating Your Installation

Ensure your GORM CLI installation is correctly set up by running a simple version check and verifying the CLI executes without errors. This step confirms that your environment is ready for code generation and lets you proceed confidently to your first model and query interface generation.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Installation

After installing GORM CLI (see [Installing GORM CLI](../setup-installation/installing-gorm-cli.md)), verifying the installation ensures the binary is accessible and properly configured.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Run the version command:**

   ```bash
   gorm --version
   ```

3. **Expected Output:**

   You should see output similar to:

   ```
   GORM CLI Tool version vX.Y.Z
   ```

   where `vX.Y.Z` is the installed GORM CLI version.

4. **Alternative check (help command):**

   ```bash
   gorm --help
   ```

   This should display the CLI usage details with commands available like `gen`.

<Tip>
Ensure your system PATH includes the directory where `gorm` was installed. If the command is not recognized, review your installation steps or PATH configuration.
</Tip>

## 2. Confirm the `gen` Command Is Ready to Use

The `gen` command is the core feature for generating code based on your raw SQL interface annotations.

### How to Check

1. Run:

   ```bash
   gorm gen --help
   ```

2. This should display usage information about the `gen` command, including required flags like `-i` (input file or directory) and `-o` (output directory).

3. Example of partial output:

   ```
   Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces

   Usage:
     gorm gen [flags]

   Flags:
     -i, --input string     Path to Go interface file with raw SQL annotations (required)
     -o, --output string    Directory to place generated code (default "./g")
   ```

<Tip>
If you receive errors or no output, the CLI installation might be incomplete or the executable is not accessible. Revisit your installation steps.
</Tip>

## 3. Run a Basic Dry-Run to Validate Environment

While a full generation requires properly written interfaces, performing a minimal dry-run confirms CLI execution:

```bash
# Replace ./examples with your interface code directory or file
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- This will attempt code generation based on your input interfaces.
- If successful, you'll see messages like:

  ```
  Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
  ```

- If there are input errors, the CLI will output relevant error messages.

<Warning>
If you don’t have interfaces defined yet, expect an error indicating missing or invalid inputs. This error shows the CLI runs but your code is not ready for generation.
</Warning>

## 4. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

| Issue                                  | Cause                                         | Solution                                              |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `gorm: command not found`              | CLI binary not in system PATH                  | Add Go bin directory (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin`) to PATH    |
| Version or help commands produce error | Installation incomplete or corrupted           | Reinstall using `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` |
| `missing required flag: input` error  | `-i` flag not provided when running `gen`      | Supply input file path with `-i [path]`              |
| Permission denied on output directory  | Write permission missing in output folder      | Choose a directory with write access or run as admin |

## 5. Confirming Successful Validation

When the following conditions are met, your installation is validated:

- Running `gorm --version` outputs the CLI version.
- Running `gorm gen --help` shows usage info without errors.
- Running `gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated` executes and generates output files (assuming valid interfaces).

<Tip>
Following successful validation, proceed to writing your first model and query interfaces, then generate your code as outlined in subsequent getting started guides.
</Tip>
