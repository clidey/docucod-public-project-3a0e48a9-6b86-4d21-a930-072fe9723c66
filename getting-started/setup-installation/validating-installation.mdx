# Validating Your Installation

Quickly confirm that your GORM CLI installation is set up correctly by running the CLI and verifying that expected outputs appear. This guide will walk you through essential checks, common troubleshooting scenarios, and what to do when issues arise.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Version

Ensure the CLI is installed and accessible in your system PATH by checking its version.

```bash
gorm version
```

**Expected result:**
- The CLI should output its current version number without errors.

If the command returns "command not found" or similar, the CLI executable is not in your PATH.

<Warning>
If you encounter a 'command not found' error, it indicates that your shell cannot locate the GORM CLI executable. Double-check your Go `GOPATH` bin directory and ensure it is included in your system PATH.
</Warning>

---

## 2. Confirm Go Version Compatibility

GORM CLI requires Go version 1.18 or higher due to generic support.

Run:

```bash
go version
```

**Expected result:**
- The output should display `go version go1.18` or higher.

If your Go version is below 1.18, update Go to meet this requirement before proceeding.

---

## 3. Test `gorm gen` Command

Run the `gen` command's help to verify the CLI command structure is available.

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

**Expected result:**
- Display of usage instructions for the `gen` subcommand including flags: `--input/-i`, `--output/-o`.

---

## 4. Validate Basic Code Generation Workflow

Test generating code from an example interface file. This ensures the CLI runs fully and generates output.

### Create a simple example interface file (e.g., `example.go`):

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}
```

### Run generation:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

**Expected result:**
- CLI outputs generation progress messages without errors.
- Generated code files appear under the `./generated` directory.

## 5. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI Command Not Found">

- **Problem:** Running `gorm` returns 'command not found'.
- **Cause:** Go bin directory is missing from your system PATH.
- **Fix:** Add Go's bin directory to PATH:

  - On Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

  Add this to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to persist.

  - On Windows:
  Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to the PATH environment variable via System Properties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Old">

- **Problem:** `gorm version` or `go version` shows Go < 1.18.
- **Cause:** Installed Go is outdated.
- **Fix:** Download and install the latest Go version from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied When Running gorm">

- **Problem:** `permission denied` error when running `gorm`.
- **Cause:** CLI binary permissions are insufficient.
- **Fix:** Change permission to executable:

```bash
chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Code Generation Fails with Syntax Errors">

- **Problem:** Running `gorm gen` fails to generate files with parse errors.
- **Cause:** Input files may have incompatible or unsupported Go syntax.
- **Fix:** Ensure input files are valid Go source and follow GORM CLI conventions for query interface annotations.
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

- Proceed with [Project Setup & Structure](/getting-started/first-steps-with-gorm-cli/project-setup) to organize your queries and models.
- Learn [Generating Type-Safe APIs](/getting-started/first-steps-with-gorm-cli/generating-code) to produce your first type-safe query code.
- Explore [Using Your First Generated APIs](/getting-started/first-steps-with-gorm-cli/basic-usage-validation) to run and validate your generated queries.

---

## Summary
Validating your GORM CLI installation involves confirming the CLI is accessible and at the correct version, verifying Go compatibility, testing basic CLI commands, and performing an initial code generation example. This ensures a smooth start for generating and using type-safe query APIs with GORM CLI.

<Tip>
Maintaining an up-to-date Go environment and keeping the GORM CLI in your PATH are crucial for avoiding common setup frustrations. Always run `gorm version` after installation to verify your setup.
