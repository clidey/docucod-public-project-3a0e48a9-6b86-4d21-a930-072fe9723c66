# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for common setup issues encountered when getting started with GORM CLI. This page provides clear, actionable solutions to typical problems such as missing dependencies, Go version mismatches, incorrect folder structures, and misconfigured generation paths or mappings.

Use this guide as your first stop if your code generation or build process signals errors related to environment setup, configuration, or input files.

---

## 1. Missing or Incorrect Dependencies

Ensure your environment has all required dependencies correctly installed and accessible.

### Check Go Version Compatibility

- GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher to support generics.

**Verify your Go version:**
```bash
go version
```

*Expected output example:* `go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64`

If your version is below 1.18, upgrade Go following the official instructions from [golang.org](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Confirm GORM is Available

GORM CLI relies on `gorm.io/gorm` installed in your Go module.

Run:
```bash
go get gorm.io/gorm
```

This ensures GORM is available for code generation and runtime use.

### Validate Project Dependencies

Run:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

to clean up and ensure all required modules for your project and generation files are correctly referenced.

<Tip>
Always run `go mod tidy` before generation to prevent missing imports or version conflicts.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Go Module and Folder Structure Issues

Correct folder structure and module setup are essential for GORM CLI to correctly parse and generate code.

### Input Path Must Be Correct

- Provide a valid and reachable path to Go source files containing your SQL-annotated interfaces.

- Use the `--input` or `-i` flag with an absolute or relative path for `gorm gen`, e.g.: 

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

- If you specify a directory, the CLI will recursively parse all Go files contained therein.

### Relative Paths and Go Modules

- The package should be part of a Go module (with a `go.mod` file) in or above your input directory.

- Ensure your import paths are valid and that Go modules are properly initialized.

### Common folder mistakes:

- Input path points to non-Go files or empty directory.
- Generated output folder overlaps with input folder causing recursive parsing bugs.

<Warning>
Avoid placing output folders inside your input folder. Use distinct paths to prevent accidental recursive processing.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Configuration Path and Mapping Errors

When declaring a `genconfig.Config` in your source package, misconfigurations can lead to unexpected behavior or generation failures.

### Verify `OutPath` Setting

- The output directory specified in your config or by CLI flag `-o` must be a valid directory path.

- Default output directory if none is provided is `./g` relative to the current directory.

Example declaration in your config:
```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "./generated",
}
```

### Field Mapping Issues

- When using `FieldTypeMap` or `FieldNameMap` in your config, ensure keys and values correspond to valid Go types and helpers.

Example of mapping a SQL null time to GORM CLI field helper:
```go
FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
  sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
},
```

- Mismatched or invalid mappings cause generation errors or incorrect field helper types.

### Interface and Struct Filtering

- Use `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, and `ExcludeStructs` carefully.

- Shell-pattern matching is supported and is case-sensitive.

Misconfiguration may result in missing generated code or partial outputs.

<Tip>
Validate your config by temporarily removing filters to confirm all interfaces and structs appear, then narrow filters once generation works.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Error Scenarios and Fixes

### Error: `error processing <path>: <error message>`

- **Cause:** Failed to parse input files.
- **Fix:** Ensure input paths are correct, files exist, and are valid Go source with no parse errors.

### Error: `failed to render template ...`

- **Cause:** Config or input interfaces/structs are malformed or contain unsupported constructs.
- **Fix:** Check your interface method comments for valid SQL annotations. Verify your `genconfig.Config` correctness.

### Missing Generated Methods or Fields

- **Cause:** Your filtering config excludes them or the input files do not define them properly.
- **Fix:** Adjust `Include*` and `Exclude*` settings in your `genconfig.Config`. Confirm interfaces and structs are properly declared and exported.

### Output Folder Not Created or No Files Generated

- **Cause:** Permission issues or misconfigured `OutPath`.
- **Fix:** Ensure you have write permissions for the output directory. Verify `OutPath` resolves correctly and does not overlap input.

## 5. Validation After Troubleshooting

After applying fixes, validate your setup:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- The CLI should output lines like:

```
Generating file ./generated/query.go from /abs/path/examples/query.go...
```

- Check the generated files for completeness.

- Run tests using examples generated, if available:

```bash
cd generated
go test ./...
```

This confirms the generated code compiles and works as expected.

## 6. Getting Further Help

- Review the [System Requirements](../../getting-started/essential-setup/requirements) to ensure your environment is fully supported.
- Revisit the [Installation](../../getting-started/essential-setup/installation) and [Configuration Basics](../../getting-started/essential-setup/configuration-basics) guides to verify your setup steps.
- For troubleshooting generation issues specifically, consult the [Quick Validation Steps](../../getting-started/validation-and-troubleshooting/quick-validation) guide.
- Join the GORM community on GitHub or forums for peer support and issue reporting.

<Tip>
Always keep your Go tools and GORM CLI updated to the latest stable releases to avoid resolved bugs or incompatibilities.
