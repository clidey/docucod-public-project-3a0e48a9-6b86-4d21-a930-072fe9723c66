# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure your installation and setup of GORM CLI produce the expected generated code and that your environment runs the generated APIs correctly. This guide walks you through practical tests to verify your GORM CLI integrationâ€™s correctness by generating code, running simple queries, and inspecting outputs.

---

## 1. Verify Installation and Basic Generation

Before running validation tests, confirm your GORM CLI is installed and can generate code correctly.

### Step 1: Generate output code from an example interface

Run the following command on a sample interface file (replace `./examples/query.go` and output path as needed):

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./examples/output
```

- This should create generated code files under `./examples/output` matching the structure of your interfaces and models.
- The output will include generated query API implementations and model-driven field helpers.

### Step 2: Confirm the generated files exist

Look for output files such as:

- `examples/output/filters/pattern/iface.go`
- `examples/output/models/user.go` (or equivalent for your project)

You should see the comment header:

```go
// Code generated by 'gorm.io/cli/gorm'. DO NOT EDIT.
```

in each generated file.

<Check>
If you do not see generated files or encounter errors, check your installation, input path, and configuration as described in the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/essential-setup/installation).
</Check>

## 2. Run Basic Queries on Generated Code

Once code generation passes, execute some test operations against a test database to verify the generated code behaves as expected.

### Step 1: Prepare your test environment

- Use a test database accessible by your Go code (SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, etc.).
- Seed test data suitable for queries.

### Step 2: Use generated query interfaces

Import your generated package and write simple query calls. Example test code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  generated "yourmodule/examples/output"
  "yourmodule/examples/models"
)

func testQueries(db *gorm.DB) {
  ctx := context.Background()
  query := generated.Query[models.User](db)

  // Example: fetch user by ID
  user, err := query.GetByID(ctx, 1)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Failed to get user by ID: %v\n", err)
  } else {
    fmt.Printf("User found: %+v\n", user)
  }

  // Example: Filter with column
  user, err = query.FilterWithColumn(ctx, "role", "active")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("FilterWithColumn error: %v\n", err)
  } else {
    fmt.Printf("Active user: %+v\n", user)
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Run your tests and confirm

- The test should successfully return data matching the seeded records.
- Confirm the return types match your models.

<Tip>
If your tests fail, consider verifying the database connection, the seed data, and ensure generated code imports and package paths are correct.
</Tip>

## 3. Validate Generated Field Helpers

Generated field helpers enable fluent query construction. Test them by running example operations using the helpers.

### Sample test examples:

```go
// Find users where age > 18 and role = "active"
var users []models.User
err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18), generated.User.Role.Eq("active")).
  Find(ctx, &users)
if err != nil {
  // handle error
}

// Update user role from "pending" to "active"
rows, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Role.Eq("pending")).
  Update(ctx, "role", "active")

// Create a new user with field helpers
err = gorm.G[models.User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("testuser"),
    generated.User.Age.Set(25),
    generated.User.Role.Set("active"),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

### Verify:

- Queries return expected records.
- Updates affect intended rows.
- Create inserts new records properly.

<Note>
Running these tests requires your database to be correctly initialized with expected schemas and seeded data.
</Note>

---

## 4. Inspect Generated Code Structure and Types

Make sure the generated code defines the expected interfaces and helpers.

### Checkpoints:

- Confirm interface implementations like `_QueryUserInterface[T]` with expected query methods such as `ByID`.

- Validate generated structs expose field helpers:

```go
var User = struct {
  ID   field.Number[uint]
  Name field.String
  Age  field.Number[int]
  Role field.String
  // ... other fields and associations
}{}
```

- Ensure helper types use correct Go generics and match your model fields.

<Tip>
Use your IDE or text search to locate generated files and examine the documented methods and fields.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Validation Pitfalls and Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Checks">
<Accordion title="Generated Methods Not Found or Missing">
- Ensure your input interface file contains proper SQL template method annotations.
- Verify your `genconfig.Config` include/exclude patterns do not filter out needed interfaces or structs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compilation Errors After Generation">
- Check generated code is properly formatted by running `go fmt` or `goimports`.
- Validate your Go version is 1.18+ for generics support.
- Confirm all required imports, including gorm.io/gorm and gorm.io/cli/gorm/field, are accessible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Queries Return No Data Unexpectedly">
- Confirm your test database is seeded with correct data.
- Check that query conditions match the seeded data.
- Validate the generated SQL syntax if debugging with database logs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Field Helpers Not Recognized or Type Mismatches">
- Review your model struct's tags and the `genconfig.Config` mappings.
- Confirm type equivalences between your models and generated field helper types.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps / Further Validation

- After validating basic queries and helpers, explore running the full generated test suite as shown in `examples/output/query_test.go` and `examples/output/models_field_helpers_test.go`.
- Use validation to guide your configuration tweaks in `genconfig.Config`.
- Once confident, proceed to build your application logic using generated types from GORM CLI.
