# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Quick solutions for frequent installation and setup errors. Learn how to diagnose path, permissions, or Go version issues so you can proceed swiftly.

## 1. Common Setup Challenges & How to Recognize Them

Before you generate code with GORM CLI's `gen` command, encountering setup hiccups is common. Knowing the signs early helps you fix problems without losing momentum.

| Issue Type           | Symptom / Error Message                                | Typical Cause                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `command not found`  | `gorm: command not found`                               | GORM CLI binary missing or PATH not set   |
| Permission Denied     | `permission denied` errors during `go install` or run | Insufficient filesystem or environment rights |
| Invalid Go Version    | `go: gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest: version selection error` | Go version < 1.18 or corrupted installation  |
| Input Path Errors     | `error processing ./path: stat ./path: no such file`    | Incorrect `-i` input path or bad relative path |

---

## 2. Diagnosing PATH and Installation Issues

Often, the system can't find `gorm` after installation because your PATH isn’t properly configured or the binary wasn't installed correctly.

### Step 1: Confirm GORM CLI Installation

Run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Expected:

- No errors during install.
- Binary installed to your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

### Step 2: Verify Binary Location

Check where Go installs binaries with:

```bash
echo $GOPATH
# or if unset
echo $HOME/go
```

Then check if `gorm` exists:

```bash
ls $GOPATH/bin/gorm
# or
ls $HOME/go/bin/gorm
```

### Step 3: Add Binary Path to System PATH

If `gorm` is present but the shell complains about command not found:

- Add the binary directory to your PATH.

For **bash/zsh** add this line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

- Confirm availability:

```bash
gorm --help
```

### Troubleshooting

- If adding PATH doesn't work, open a new terminal session.
- On Windows, add the Go bin folder to your system environment variables PATH.

<Warning>
Never run `go install` commands with root unless absolutely necessary, as it may lead to permission problems.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Resolving Permission Issues

Sometimes installation or execution errors are caused by insufficient permissions.

### Common Scenarios:

- Installation fails with `permission denied` errors.
- Unable to write generated files when running `gorm gen`.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Check directory permissions** for the project and Go bin path:

```bash
ls -ld $(go env GOPATH)/bin
ls -ld ./generated
```

2. **Adjust permissions or ownership**:

```bash
# Example: Make sure your user owns these paths
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(go env GOPATH)/bin
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ./generated
```

3. **Avoid running CLI or install commands as root** with `sudo` unless specifically required.

4. **Ensure your shell environment uses correct user permissions**.

### Troubleshooting

- If files are generated but empty or partial, check write access on the output directory.
- On Windows, verify that directories are not flagged as read-only.

---

## 4. Ensuring Your Go Version Meets Requirements

GORM CLI requires Go version 1.18 or higher because it uses generics.

### Verify Go Version

```bash
go version
```

Example output:

```
go version go1.19.3 linux/amd64
```

### Upgrade Go if Needed

- Follow the official instructions for your OS at https://golang.org/dl/

### Troubleshooting Version Mismatches

- If `go` version is correct, but `gorm gen` fails, check your environment for multiple Go installations.

```bash
which go
go env GOROOT
```

Make sure your shell uses the correct Go binary path.

---

## 5. Handling Input Path Errors

The `gorm gen` command requires a valid Go source directory or file as input.

### Symptoms

- Errors like:

```
error processing ./myinterfaces: stat ./myinterfaces: no such file or directory
```

### Action Steps

1. Confirm the input path you provide really exists:

```bash
ls ./myinterfaces
```

2. Use relative paths from your current directory or absolute paths.

3. The input must be a Go source directory or file containing interfaces with SQL annotations.

4. If running from the project root, ensure paths are relative to root or specify absolute.

Example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

### Troubleshooting

- If path has spaces or special characters, wrap in quotes.
- Use `pwd` to check your current directory.

---

## 6. Confirming Successful Setup

After installation and configuration, verify by running a simple generation:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

### Expected Outcome

- Console output shows "Generating file ... from ..."
- Generated Go files appear in `./generated` folder

<Check>
If generation completes without errors and outputs generated code files, your setup is fully operational.
</Check>
