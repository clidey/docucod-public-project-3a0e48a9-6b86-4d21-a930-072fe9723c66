# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and running GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the following prerequisites. These foundational requirements guarantee a smooth installation process and successful code generation for your Go projects.

---

### 1. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is a Go-based command-line tool designed to work seamlessly across major operating systems commonly used for Go development:

- **Linux:** Popular distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS
- **macOS:** Versions compatible with Go 1.18+ development
- **Windows:** Windows 10 and later supported; Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) can be used as well

> GORM CLI leverages Go modules and tooling, so any OS supporting Go tooling 1.18+ will work.


### 2. Go Version Requirement

To use GORM CLI effectively, your system must have:

- **Go 1.18 or later:** 
  - Generics support introduced in Go 1.18 is essential for generating type-safe APIs.
  - Ensure your `go` command line tool is at least version 1.18 by running:

```bash
go version
```

- Upgrade Go if the version is older:

```bash
# example for Ubuntu
sudo snap install go --classic --channel=1.20
```


### 3. Memory and Storage

- **Memory:** Minimum 1 GB RAM recommended for typical code generation workflows.
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB available for the CLI installation and generated code files.

Large projects with extensive interfaces and model definitions will require proportionally more resources.


### 4. Network Requirements

- An internet connection is required to install GORM CLI via Go modules:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- No runtime network access is required to generate code locally once installed.


### 5. Database Environment (Optional for Code Generation)

While not mandatory for code generation, if you intend to generate code that depends on live database schema or to run tests, you should have:

- **Compatible Database:** Typically MySQL (version 5.7+) or any database supported by GORM.
- **Sample MySQL Setup:** You can use a Docker Compose configuration for local setup as shown below:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  mysql:
    image: 'mysql:latest'
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9910:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=gorm
      - MYSQL_USER=gorm
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=gorm
      - MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD="yes"
```

- Access MySQL database at `127.0.0.1:9910` with user `gorm` and password `gorm`.


### 6. Command Line Tools

- A terminal or shell environment comfortably supports executing Go commands.
- **Cobra CLI dependency:** GORM CLI uses Cobra framework internally but no action needed by users besides CLI usage.

## Best Practices

- Confirm your Go environment by running `go env` to verify `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` are properly set.
- Use Go modules (`go.mod`) in your projects to manage dependencies.
- Keep your system Go version updated to benefit from bug fixes and optimizations.
- If you plan on integrating with databases, test connectivity and credentials before running generation workflows.

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
If your `go version` reports lower than 1.18:

- Upgrade Go following official instructions for your platform.
- Alternatively, use containerized development environments with the proper Go version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network/Proxy Issues When Installing CLI">
If `go install` hangs or fails:

- Check your internet connectivity.
- Ensure `GOPROXY` environment variable is set correctly (`https://proxy.golang.org`).
- Temporarily disable firewall or proxy interfering with Go module proxy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Database Connection Errors">
If you're using local MySQL and encounter connection errors:

- Verify Docker Compose container is running.
- Double-check exposed port `9910` and user credentials.
- Test connection using a MySQL client app.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary Checklist

<Check>
- Operating system is Linux, macOS, or Windows with Go 1.18+
- Go environment correctly installed and verifiable
- Adequate memory and disk space available
- Network configured for `go install` commands
- (Optional) Database environment set up if database-dependent code generation or testing is planned
</Check>
