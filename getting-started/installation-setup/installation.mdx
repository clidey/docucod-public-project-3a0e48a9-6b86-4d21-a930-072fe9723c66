# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

Follow these clear, step-by-step instructions to install GORM CLI on your development environment. This guide walks you through the required prerequisites, the installation command using Go's toolchain, version considerations, verification of your installation, and basic troubleshooting tips.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment is set up properly for a seamless experience:

- **Go Version:** GORM CLI requires Go version 1.18 or newer, as it leverages Go generics extensively.
- **Operating Systems Supported:** Any OS that supports Go 1.18+ (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Network Access:** Your environment needs internet access to download the module via Go tooling.
- **Go Environment Setup:** Confirm that your `$GOPATH` and `PATH` environment variables are configured to allow installed binaries to be executed globally.

<Tip>
If you haven’t installed Go, download and install it from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Using go install

The recommended way to install GORM CLI is through the Go toolchain's `go install` command. This handles downloading, compiling, and installing the binary automatically.

```bash
# Install the latest version of GORM CLI
GO111MODULE=on go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command fetches the latest release from the `gorm.io/cli/gorm` package repository and installs the `gorm` executable into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory (or `$GOBIN` if set).
- Ensure that this binary path is in your system’s `PATH` so you can run `gorm` from anywhere.

### Version Notes

- Installing with `@latest` always fetches the newest stable GORM CLI release.
- To install a specific version, replace `@latest` with the exact version tag, for example:
  
  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v0.1.3
  ```

### Platform-specific considerations

- On Windows, ensure PowerShell or Command Prompt has `$GOPATH/bin` in the user environment `PATH`.
- On Unix/macOS, add `export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"` to your shell profile.

## 3. Verification of Installation

Once installed, confirm that GORM CLI was installed correctly and is accessible.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see output similar to:

```text
Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

3. This confirms that the CLI is correctly installed and ready to use.

<Tip>
If the command is not found, verify your `$PATH` includes the Go bin directory.
</Tip>

## 4. Basic Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them during installation:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI command not found after installation">
- Confirm that your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin`) is added to your system `PATH`.
- Restart your terminal or log out and back in after modifying environment variables.
- Use `echo $PATH` (Linux/macOS) or `echo %PATH%` (Windows) to inspect your current path.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18 or command fails">
- Check your Go version with `go version`.
- Upgrade to Go 1.18+ from https://golang.org/dl/.
- Ensure multiple Go versions are not conflicting on your system.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network connectivity issues during go install">
- Confirm you have internet access and can reach `gorm.io`.
- If behind proxy/firewall, configure Go proxy settings or adjust firewall rules.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps

With GORM CLI installed, you are ready to generate your first query APIs from Go interfaces and models, leveraging the power of type safety and fluent API design.

- Proceed to the [First Code Generation Guide](../first-usage/first-code-generation) to learn how to create your first generated APIs.
- Review the [Configuration Essentials](./initial-configuration) page if you want to customize generation output paths or mappings.
