# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Prepare your development environment to ensure smooth installation and effective use of GORM CLI for generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is a Go-based code generation tool and runs anywhere Go 1.18+ is supported, including:

- Linux (various distributions)
- macOS
- Windows

**Note:** Ensure your OS environment supports Go toolchain installation and running executables.

---

## 2. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in Go 1.18.

- **Minimum Go version:** 1.18 or higher
- Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

If your Go version is lower than 1.18, upgrade it to utilize GORM CLI.

---

## 3. Dependencies & Environment Setup

Before installing or running GORM CLI, make sure you have the following:

- **Go Toolchain:** Installed and configured in your system `PATH`.
- **GORM Library:** Your project should use `gorm.io/gorm` (version compatible with Go 1.18+ generics).

---

## 4. Network & Access Considerations

- No special network ports or firewall changes are required for local development.
- Internet access is needed only during installation for downloading the CLI module.

---

## 5. Development Environment Preparation

Ensure the following to avoid common pitfalls:

- **Working Go Module:** Your project should be using Go Modules (with a `go.mod` file).
- **Directory Structure:** Keep your query interface files and model definitions organized in the same package or directory for smooth generation.
- **Editor/IDE Setup:** Use editors with Go support for autocompletion and error highlighting.

---

## Troubleshooting Prerequisites

<Tip>
If you encounter errors during installation or generation, verify your Go version and environment setup first. Run `go env` to check key paths and module settings.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Attempting to run GORM CLI with an unsupported Go version will cause compile-time errors. Always use Go 1.18 or above.
</Warning>

## Recap Checklist Before Installation

- [x] Operating system supports Go 1.18+
- [x] Go runtime installed and accessible
- [x] Go version verified (`go version`)
- [x] Your project uses Go Modules
- [x] Model structs and query interfaces ready in your project

---

## Next Steps

Once your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Install GORM CLI](../installation-setup/install-cli.md) page to install the CLI tool and start generating your first type-safe query code.
