# Install GORM CLI

Step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI using Go tooling. This guide covers installation methods across different platforms, validation of your installation, and solutions for common installation issues.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or higher (required for generics support).
- **Operating Systems Supported:** Any OS with Go tooling support (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Go Environment:** GOPATH and GOBIN properly configured for `go install` command to succeed.

<Tip>
If you haven’t already set up Go or need to upgrade, download the latest Go release from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

GORM CLI installs using Go’s `go install` command to fetch the latest version and place the binary in your Go bin directory.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install via Go Install">
Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This downloads the latest GORM CLI version.
- The binary will be placed in your `$GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
- Ensure this directory is in your system `PATH` environment variable to run the `gorm` command anywhere.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Go Version">
Confirm your Go version supports generics (1.18+):

```bash
go version
```

Expected output example:

```
go version go1.19.1 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, upgrade Go before continuing.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Go Bin to PATH (if needed)">
If `gorm` command isn’t recognized after install, add Go bin to your PATH.

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
```

Restart your terminal after updating the PATH.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Validation of Installation

After installation, verify the GORM CLI is properly set up.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check GORM CLI Version">
Run:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output:

```
GORM CLI Tool version x.y.z
```

If the version prints, installation succeeded.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Basic Command Help">
Execute:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI’s help menu listing available commands, including `gen`.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If either `gorm` command is not found or returns errors, verify PATH configuration and Go version.
</Check>

## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

- **Linux/macOS**: Installation via the above steps is fully supported.

- **Windows**: Use PowerShell or cmd with the same `go install` command. Update PATH environment via System Settings or PowerShell.

- **Proxy settings**: If behind a proxy, configure GOPROXY accordingly:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

## 5. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Install">
- **Symptoms:** Typing `gorm` results in “command not found”.
- **Cause:** Go binary location not in PATH.
- **Solutions:**
  - Add $(go env GOPATH)/bin to your PATH.
  - Confirm you ran `go install` successfully.
  - Restart terminal or shell to reload PATH.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Unsupported">
- **Symptoms:** Installation fails or CLI commands error with generics-related messages.
- **Cause:** Go version lower than 1.18.
- **Solutions:**
  - Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or higher.
  - Verify with `go version` after upgrade.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Failures During Installation">
- **Symptoms:** `go install` fails to download modules.
- **Cause:** Network restrictions or missing proxy configuration.
- **Solutions:**
  - Confirm internet connectivity.
  - Configure GOPROXY environment variable:

    ```bash
    go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
    ```

  - Check firewall or VPN settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
- **Symptoms:** Errors writing to Go bin directories.
- **Cause:** Insufficient filesystem permissions.
- **Solutions:**
  - On Linux/macOS, use sudo only if necessary to change ownership of GOPATH/bin.
  - Alternatively, change GOBIN to a directory where you have write access.
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps

Once the GORM CLI is installed and validated, proceed to:

- Write your first query interfaces and models ([Quickstart Workflow](../getting-started-examples/quickstart-workflow))
- Generate your initial code with `gorm gen` command
- Learn how to integrate generated code into your GORM projects ([Integration with GORM](../overview/getting-started-examples/integration-with-gorm))

For more detailed system setup or environment preparation, see [System Requirements & Prerequisites](../getting-started/installation-setup/prerequisites).
