# Validate Installation

Quickly verify that GORM CLI is correctly installed and accessible in your environment. This guide walks you through running the CLI tool and interpreting its output, ensuring your setup is ready before you proceed to code generation.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Installation

After installing GORM CLI using Go's installation command, the first practical step is to confirm the binary is available and responding.

### Step 1: Confirm `gorm` Command Availability

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gorm version
```

- **Expected Outcome**: You should see version information or a help message indicating the CLI is installed.

- **If you receive a 'command not found' error:**
  - Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go's default bin directory is in your system PATH.
  - On Unix-like systems, you can add it temporarily with:

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```

### Step 2: Get Help Listing

Getting a list of available commands confirms the CLI's core functionality.

```bash
gorm --help
```

- **Expected Output**: A help screen showing commands like `gen` and usage instructions.

- This confirms the CLI binary loads and is ready to accept commands.

<Note>
If `--help` does not display command options or you see errors, reinstall GORM CLI following the installation guide and check your environment variables.
</Note>

---

## 2. Run a Simple Command to Validate

The key command to use GORM CLI is `gen` (generate). To validate, try running it with minimal arguments.

### Step 1: Check `gen` Command Usage

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

- You should see usage instructions for the `gen` command, flags like `-i` (input) and `-o` (output).

- This confirms the generator sub-command is registered and functioning.

<Warning>
The `gen` command requires at least the `-i` flag pointing to a Go source file or directory containing SQL interface definitions. Running without `-i` will result in an error.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Run a Dry-Run or Help to Confirm No Errors

Try invoking the command with minimal setup just to see error handling:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples
```

- This will attempt code generation in the `./examples` directory (replace with your path).

- Since you may not have setup yet, the CLI will report missing input or configuration errors if the directory/file is not valid.

- Running the help command is the recommended first step rather than running generation without proper input.

---

## 3. Confirm Success of Installation

A successful installation is confirmed once:

- The `gorm` tool responds with version or help output.
- The `gorm gen --help` command displays usage instructions.
- You can invoke `gorm gen -i <valid-path>` without system errors (even if code generation is pending).

<Check>
If these steps succeed, your GORM CLI is installed and ready for your first code generation workflows.
</Check>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="`gorm` command not found after installation">
- Verify the Go bin directory is in your PATH (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`).
- Restart your terminal session or source your profile.
- Reinstall using `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Running `gorm gen` without input path error">
- Always provide the `-i` flag pointing to the source directory or file with your interfaces.
- Example: `gorm gen -i ./examples`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version mismatch or Go environment issues">
- Confirm your Go version is 1.18 or higher with generics support.
- Check by running `go version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied or binary execution issues">
- Check file permissions on the `gorm` binary.
- On Unix systems, run `chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm` if necessary.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Where to Go From Here

Once your installation is verified and the CLI responds correctly, you're ready to:

- Write your first query interfaces and models.
- Use `gorm gen -i <path>` to generate type-safe, interface-driven query code.
- Integrate generated code with your GORM project.

Explore these documentation pages next for a smooth onboarding:

- [Minimal Project Setup](../config-gen-first-run/minimal-setup) - Prepare your models and interfaces.
- [Generate Code: Your First Run](../config-gen-first-run/run-generator) - Run the generator with practical examples.
- [Using the Generated APIs](../config-gen-first-run/using-generated) - Learn how to use the generated code.
