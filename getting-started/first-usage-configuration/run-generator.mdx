# Generate Code: Your First Run

This guide walks you through your first experience running the `gorm gen` command. By following these steps, you will generate Go code from your annotated interface files and immediately see executable outputs. This hands-on approach helps you build confidence and understand key command flags, expected results, and troubleshooting tips.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Setup Confirmation

Before running the command, ensure the following:

- **Go environment** on your machine with version 1.18 or higher.
- **GORM CLI installed** using:

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```

- A prepared Go project with **query interfaces** and **model structs**, annotated with raw SQL in comments, typically in files like `examples/query.go`.

- Confirm your working directory contains or can access the interface file(s) you want to generate code from.

<Tip>
You can verify your Go version with `go version` and your GORM CLI installation by running `gorm gen --help` to see if the CLI responds correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding the `gorm gen` Command

The `gorm gen` command reads interface files containing annotated SQL templates and generates type-safe, fluent Go code to execute those queries via GORM.

### Key Flags:

| Flag          | Shortcut | Description                                   | Required    |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `--input`     | `-i`     | Path to your Go interface file/directory     | Yes         |
| `--output`    | `-o`     | Target directory for generated code (default: `./g`) | No          |

### The Typical Command Format:

```bash
gorm gen -i <input-path> -o <output-dir>
```

Where `<input-path>` points to your annotated interface file or directory, and `<output-dir>` is where generated code files will be placed.

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide: Running Your First Code Generation

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate Your Interface File">
Identify the Go file containing your annotated interfaces with raw SQL string comments, for example, `examples/query.go`.

This file defines interface methods with embedded SQL queries used by the generator.
</Step>
<Step title="Open a Terminal in Your Project Root">
Navigate to the root folder of your Go project where you can reach the interface files easily.
Use your terminal or command prompt.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Generator Command">
Execute the `gorm gen` command specifying the input interface file and output directory:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

If you omit `-o`, the default `./g` directory will be used.
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Command Execution and Output">
The tool will process the Go files, walk through annotations, and generate typed code in the output directory.

Example output snippet:

```text
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

This confirms successful generation.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify the Generated Code">
Check the output folder (`./generated` in this example) for new Go files.
Generated files contain:
- Implementations of your query interface methods
- Struct and field helpers for model types referenced

Open and review the generated code for confirmation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. What Happens Under the Hood?

The `gorm gen` command internally:

- Parses your input Go interface files, extracting SQL template comments per method.
- Validates method signatures to ensure they comply with expectations (e.g., return error as last value).
- Generates concrete implementations that embed your SQL templates into type-safe Go methods.
- Applies any configuration found in package-level `genconfig.Config` values.
- Creates typed field helpers based on your model structs.

This enables fluent query building and execution with compile-time safety.

## 5. Common Flags and Their Effects

| Flag       | Example                  | Effect   |
|------------|--------------------------|----------|
| `-i`       | `./examples`             | Processes all interface files in the directory recursively |
| `-o`       | `./generated`            | Places generated files into this directory |

## 6. Sample Command and Expected Output

Assuming your workspace layout:
```plaintext
./examples/query.go
./examples/models/user.go
```
Run:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Expected terminal output:
```text
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

After this completes, you should see `query.go` generated in `./generated`, containing your typed interface implementations.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Run">
<Accordion title="Command Fails with 'input required' or 'input path not found'">
- Ensure the `-i` flag points to a valid Go file or directory.
- Use relative or absolute paths carefully.
- Verify file permissions allow reading.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated Files Not Appearing or Empty">
- Check if your interface file contains valid SQL annotations in the comments.
- Confirm that the annotated methods have proper signatures (e.g., return error).
- Look for error messages during execution.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Panics or Errors During Generation">
- Review error messages carefully.
- Ensure Go version is 1.18 or newer.
- Confirm your interfaces and models follow the expected format.
- Check that no files contain the code-generated header causing them to be skipped mistakenly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output Directory Permissions Issue">
- Make sure you have write permissions to the output directory.
- Create the directory manually if necessary.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps After Generating Code

- Review the generated code to understand the method implementations.
- Import and use the generated APIs in your application.

For detailed usage, see the [Use the Generated APIs](#) guide.

- Customize generation with optional `genconfig.Config` to control output paths, type mappings, or filtering.
See [Optional: Basic Generator Configuration](#) for more.

- Explore advanced SQL template features and field helper usage in [Template-Driven Queries & SQL Templates](#) and [Field Helpers: Filters and Updates](#).

## Appendix: Example Command and Output

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

```
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

## Callouts

<Check>
The `input` flag is mandatory and must point to an existing Go file or directory containing interfaces.
</Check>

<Tip>
Default output directory is `./g`. Use `-o` to specify a more meaningful path, such as `./generated`.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Generated files overwrite existing files in the output directory with the same name.
Make backups if needed.
</Warning>
