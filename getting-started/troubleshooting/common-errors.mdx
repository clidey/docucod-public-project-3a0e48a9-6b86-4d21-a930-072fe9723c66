# Solving Common Errors

This page addresses frequent problems encountered when using GORM CLI such as Go version mismatches, code generation failures, or the CLI not being found. Each issue is presented with clear, step-by-step fixes to swiftly reduce friction and help you regain momentum in your development workflow.

---

## 1. Go Version Mismatch

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher for generics support. Using an older Go version will cause build and generation failures.

### How to Check Your Go Version

Run:
```bash
go version
```

The output should be at least `go1.18`.

### Fix

1. If your Go version is below 1.18, upgrade Go:
   - Download the latest stable Go release at [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl).
   - Follow installation instructions for your OS.
2. Confirm the upgrade was successful by rerunning `go version`.

### Troubleshooting
- If you have multiple Go versions installed, ensure your shell uses the correct `go` binary. Adjust your `PATH` environment variable accordingly.
- On systems using version managers (e.g., `gvm`, `asdf`), switch to the appropriate Go version.

<Warning>
Using an unsupported Go version is the most common cause of generation failures. Always keep Go updated to at least 1.18 when working with GORM CLI.
</Warning>

## 2. GORM CLI Not Found After Installation

After running the install command, your terminal might not recognize the `gorm` command.

### Cause
The go `bin` directory where `gorm` installs the binary is not included in your system's `PATH`.

### Fix

1. Determine your Go `bin` directory:

   - Usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.
   - Check by running:
   ```bash
go env GOPATH
```
   - The `gorm` binary will be installed at `$GOPATH/bin/gorm`.

2. Add this directory to your PATH environment variable:

   - For Bash:
     ```bash
     echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

   - For Zsh:
     ```bash
     echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

3. Verify:

   ```bash
gorm --version
```

Should output version information.

### Alternative Check
If you installed `gorm` in module mode:
```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Make sure go binary cache is not outdated by running:
```bash
go clean -modcache
```

Then reinstall.

<Note>
If you installed with `sudo`, the binary might be located in a root-owned directory. Install without `sudo` to avoid permission issues.
</Note>

## 3. Code Generation Failures

When invoking the generator (`gorm gen`) the process might fail with errors like parse errors, invalid SQL template syntax, or missing input files.

### Common Causes & Steps to Fix

#### a) Input File Not Found or Invalid

- Verify the path passed to `-i` or `--input` is correct and points to a valid Go file.
- The file must contain appropriate Go interfaces with SQL annotations.

Example command:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

If the file path is wrong or inaccessible, the generator will error.

#### b) SQL Template Syntax Errors

- GORM CLI uses a SQL templating syntax with directives like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}}`, `{{for}}`.
- Missing closing `{{end}}` or malformed directives cause parse errors.

**Fix:**
- Carefully review your interface comments for matched `{{end}}` for each `{{if}}`, `{{for}}`, and `{{where}}`.

#### c) Unsupported Method Signatures

- Methods must return at least an error or an error plus a result.
- Up to two return values are allowed; the last must be error.

If your method signature violates these rules, fix accordingly.

#### d) Configuration Conflicts

- If you use a `genconfig.Config` in your package, ensure it is correctly formatted and the path is valid.
- Misconfigured `IncludeInterfaces` or `ExcludeStructs` filter out everything.

Verify your config variables, and simplify filters to isolate the problem.

### Debugging Steps

- Run the generator command with verbose output (if available) or check command line output carefully.
- Validate your SQL templates independently for matching braces and syntax.
- Isolate interface methods by commenting out complex ones.

<Warning>
Generation failures due to code or template errors are common when adapting to new query interfaces. Start with minimal interfaces and add complexity gradually.
</Warning>

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Their Remedies

| Error Scenario                                | Likely Cause                                       | Fix                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `unknown directive` or `unclosed block(s) at EOF` | Missing or mismatched `{{end}}` in SQL templates | Add matching `{{end}}` for every `{{if}}`, `{{for}}`   |
| Methods returning wrong types                  | Method signature rules violated                    | Ensure last return is `error`, max two returns           |
| Generated code does not show expected methods | Filters exclude interfaces                          | Adjust `IncludeInterfaces` and `ExcludeInterfaces`      |
| `params = append` count mismatch or panic     | Incorrect placeholder usage in SQL comments        | Check placeholder syntax like `@param` and `@@table`   |

## 5. Troubleshooting Commands

### Verify Go Version
```bash
go version
```

### Check if `gorm` CLI is installed
```bash
which gorm
# or
gorm --version
```

### Run Generator Verbosely (using `-v` if supported by your CLI version)
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated -v
```

### Validate Generated Code Compilation
After generation, compile your project:
```bash
go build ./...
```
Fix any compilation errors reported.

## 6. Additional Tips

- Always upgrade to the latest stable version of GORM CLI.
- When modifying SQL templates, add or remove one directive at a time to isolate issues.
- Use example interfaces from official documentation as references.
- Keep your `genconfig.Config` minimum at the start; add complexity only when stable.
