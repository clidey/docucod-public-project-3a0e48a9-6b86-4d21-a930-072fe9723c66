# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems encountered while using GORM CLI, such as Go version conflicts, missing dependencies, code generation errors, and runtime misconfigurations. Follow the step-by-step diagnosis and remediation actions below to get back on track swiftly.

---

## 1. Go Version Mismatch

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or later to support generics.

### Symptoms
- Installation fails or command not found errors when running `gorm gen`.
- Compilation errors referencing generics or unsupported syntax.

### Resolution Steps
1. Check your currently installed Go version:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. If the version is older than 1.18, upgrade Go:

   - Download the latest Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
   - Follow the official installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Verify the new version is active:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

4. Reinstall GORM CLI:

   ```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
   ```

<Tip>
Always ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory is in your system `PATH` to run installed CLI tools like `gorm` directly.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Missing or Incorrect Dependencies

GORM CLI depends on Go modules and your project’s dependencies like GORM itself.

### Symptoms
- Errors during code generation such as missing packages
- `cannot find package` errors

### Resolution Steps

1. Confirm your project uses Go modules by checking for a `go.mod` file at your project root.
2. Run dependency tidy to fetch and verify modules:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Verify that `gorm.io/gorm` is included and correctly resolved.

4. Ensure your code files import GORM and related packages correctly.

<Tip>
If your project is not using Go modules, initialize it with:

```bash
go mod init <module-name>
go mod tidy
```

Then retry code generation.
</Tip>

## 3. Code Generation Failures

Issues during running `gorm gen` or related commands often stem from project structure or interface definition problems.

### Common Causes & Fixes

| Issue | Remedy |
|---|---|
| **No interfaces or structs detected** | Verify your Go files define exported interfaces and structs as expected. Check that your interfaces contain proper method comments with SQL templates. |
| **Incorrect configuration of Include/Exclude filters** | Review any `genconfig.Config` in your packages. Overly restrictive Include/Exclude rules might omit required interfaces or structs. Temporarily remove filters to isolate. |
| **Syntax errors in SQL templates** | Ensure your SQL template comments follow the DSL and syntax described in the Generating Code guide. Syntax errors cause parser failures. |
| **Generated files overwritten or skipped** | Check that output directory permissions allow file creation. Also, `gorm gen` skips files with existing generated headers. Remove stale generated files and retry. |

### Diagnosis
Run `gorm gen -i <input-path> -o <output-path>` with verbose or debug logs if available. Check console for specific error messages.

<Tip>
Start with minimal, working query interfaces and models as per examples, then gradually add to your project. This iterative approach isolates issues efficiently.
</Tip>

## 4. Runtime Errors After Generation

After successful code generation, you might encounter errors using the generated APIs.

### Common Scenarios

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Method not found or undefined symbols** | Generated code not imported or built in your application. | Ensure generated files are part of your Go module and properly imported in your code. Use `go build` to catch compile errors. |
| **SQL errors or invalid query bindings** | Issues in SQL templates or field mappings causing runtime SQL problems. | Verify your SQL templates for correctness and parameter binding. Use generated field helpers as intended. |
| **Context missing in method calls** | Generated methods expect `context.Context` as first parameter. | Always pass `ctx context.Context` to generated query methods as required. |

### Example
```go
// Correct usage of generated Query API
ctx := context.Background()
user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

## 5. Troubleshooting Workflow

Follow this sequence to troubleshoot most issues:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Go Version">
Run `go version` and ensure 1.18+.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Dependencies">
Run `go mod tidy` to fix dependency issues.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Project Structure">
Verify your Go interfaces and models are correctly defined and exported.
</Step>
<Step title="Review genconfig.Config">
Look for any filters that might exclude your types.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Code Generator with Verbose Logging">
Execute `gorm gen` and observe any errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Generated Files">
Check the generated code and import it properly in your app.
</Step>
<Step title="Test with Sample Code">
Write simple calls using generated APIs with `context.Context`.
</Step>
</Steps>
