# Common Installation Issues

When setting up the GORM CLI tool, users can encounter several frequent errors related to environment configuration, Go runtime version mismatches, and PATH setup. This guide provides actionable solutions for the most common installation problems, enabling you to promptly correct issues and ensure a smooth start.

---

## 1. Go Version Mismatch

**Symptom:**

- Running `gorm` commands throws errors mentioning generics support missing or unsupported syntax.
- The CLI fails to build or install with complaints about `go install` or modules.

**Cause:**

- GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher because it uses generics.
- Your system's Go version is older than 1.18 or mismatched.

### How to Check Your Go Version

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```

Verify the output includes `go1.18` or higher, for example:

```
go version go1.20 linux/amd64
```

### Resolution Steps

1. If your Go version is lower than 1.18, update it:
   - Visit the official Go downloads page: https://golang.org/dl/
   - Download and install the latest stable version for your OS.

2. After installation, verify the version again with `go version`.

3. Ensure your shell is using the correct Go binary (sometimes multiple Go versions installed can conflict):

```bash
which go
```

It should point to your updated Go installation.

<Tip>
Updating to at least Go 1.18 is mandatory as GORM CLI leverages generics, which are not supported in earlier versions.

## 2. CLI Binary Not Found in PATH

**Symptom:**

- Running `gorm` or `gorm gen` produces a `command not found` or similar error.

**Cause:**

- The GORM CLI binary is installed in a directory that is not included in your system `PATH` environment variable.

### How to Verify Installation Path

If you installed GORM CLI using the recommended command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

The binary will be placed inside your Go `bin` directory.

Run:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

Note the directory printed, then check the binary path:

```bash
ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```

If the file exists, this confirms the binary is installed.

### How to Add GOPATH/bin to PATH

1. Add the Go binary directory to your shell's PATH environment variable.

For macOS/Linux (bash/zsh typical):

```bash
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

Add this line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` to make it persistent.

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
```

Or add permanently through System Environment Variables settings.

2. Reload your shell or restart terminal.

3. Confirm `gorm` is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI usage instructions.

<Warning>
Avoid installing GORM CLI to system directories manually; always use the Go toolchain (`go install`) to keep versioning consistent.
</Warning>

## 3. Permission Denied or Executable Not Allowed

**Symptom:**

- After installation, running `gorm` yields `permission denied`.

**Cause:**

- The binary does not have execution permissions.

### Resolution Steps

1. Manually add execution permission:

```bash
chmod +x $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```

2. Confirm execution now works:

```bash
gorm version
```

If problems persist, ensure your filesystem supports execution rights (not common on Windows or certain mounted volumes).

## 4. Module Proxy or Network Issues During Installation

**Symptom:**

- `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` hangs or fails with module download errors.

**Cause:**

- Network connectivity problems, Go module proxy issues, or firewall restrictions.

### Resolution Steps

1. Confirm internet connectivity.

2. Try disabling Go module proxy temporarily:

```bash
export GOPROXY=direct
```

or

```bash
set GOPROXY=direct
```

on Windows PowerShell.

3. Run installation again.

4. If behind a corporate proxy or firewall, ensure the correct proxy settings are configured.

5. Refer to the Go modules proxy documentation for troubleshooting:

https://golang.org/ref/mod#module-proxy

---

## 5. Running Installation Command with Incorrect Go Version Path

**Symptom:**

- Multiple Go versions exist and installation uses older Go.

**Cause:**

- Your shell `go` command points to an older or incorrect Go binary.

### Resolution Steps

1. Check the Go executable location:

```bash
which go
```

2. If it points to a non-updated version, adjust your PATH so that the new Go binary directory appears first.

3. Verify the version again with `go version`.

4. Uninstall or remove old Go installations if not needed.

## Additional Tips

- Always run `gorm version` after installation to verify.
- Consider reinstalling if the CLI behaves unexpectedly.

<Tip>
If problems remain unresolved, consult the [GORM CLI Troubleshooting Generation & Output](https://gorm.io/cli/getting-started/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-generation) page for related issues during code generation.
