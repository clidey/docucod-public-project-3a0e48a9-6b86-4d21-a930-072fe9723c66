# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses frequent problems you may encounter during the installation, configuration, or initial code generation phases of using GORM CLI. It helps you diagnose and resolve common issues related to Go version incompatibilities, missing dependencies, CLI misconfiguration, or environment setup problems.

---

## 1. Installation-Related Issues

### Problem: `gorm` Command Not Found After Installation

**Cause:**
- The `gorm` binary is not in your system's `$PATH`.
- Go binaries directory is not configured correctly.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Ensure you have run the installation command:

    ```bash
    go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
    ```

2. Verify your Go binaries directory is in your `$PATH`. On most systems, this is `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

3. Add it to your shell environment if missing, for example (bash/zsh):

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```

4. Restart your terminal or source your profile:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
    ```

5. Confirm availability:

    ```bash
    gorm version
    ```

### Problem: Go Version Error – Requirement for Go 1.18+

**Cause:**
- Your environment uses an older Go version incompatible with GORM CLI's generics usage.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check your Go version:

    ```bash
    go version
    ```

2. Update Go to version 1.18 or later by downloading from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

3. Verify upgrade success by running `go version` again.

### Problem: Installation Fails Due to Network or Proxy Issues

**Cause:**
- Network restrictions or proxy misconfigurations blocking module downloads.

**Resolution Steps:**
- Ensure your internet connection allows Go module fetching.
- Configure Go proxy settings if behind a proxy:

    ```bash
    go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
    ```

- Try `go clean -modcache` to clear the module cache.

## 2. Configuration Errors

### Problem: `genconfig.Config` Not Being Picked Up

**Cause:**
- The configuration file is not in the correct package or directory.
- File-level vs package-level config confusion.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Verify that your `genconfig.Config` declaration is inside the package that contains your query interfaces or models.

2. If you are applying config only per file, ensure `FileLevel` is set to `true`; otherwise, set to `false` for package-wide.

3. Check for typos or incorrect package imports.

4. Review example configurations in [examples/query.go](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/blob/main/examples/query.go).

## 3. Code Generation Problems

### Problem: `gorm gen` Fails with "Input Path not specified" or Related Errors

**Cause:**
- Missing required `-i` (input) flag specifying the input Go file or directory.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Always specify the input path with the `-i` flag:

    ```bash
    gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
    ```

2. Confirm the input path contains your annotated interfaces with raw SQL templates.

### Problem: Generated Code Is Empty or Missing Expected Types

**Cause:**
- Misconfiguration of inclusion/exclusion patterns.
- Your interfaces or models do not match the configured criteria.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check your `genconfig.Config` settings such as `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, and `ExcludeStructs`.
2. Simplify your config by temporarily removing filters to generate everything.
3. Confirm your interfaces are correctly annotated with SQL comments as per [examples/query.go](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/blob/main/examples/query.go).

### Problem: Error During Generation — "error render template got error"

**Cause:**
- Annotations or SQL templates may have syntax errors.
- Go code syntax or ambiguous placeholders.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Review your interface method comments for proper SQL template syntax.
2. Ensure all placeholders use `@param` style and directives like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}` are correctly closed.
3. Refer to the [Template DSL Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/gorm.io/cli/gorm#section-readme) for valid directives.
4. Use smaller input files to isolate errors.

## 4. Runtime and Usage Issues

### Problem: Generated APIs Fail at Compile-Time

**Cause:**
- Incorrect import paths.
- Generated code not properly included in your project modules.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm your Go module setup includes the generated code directory.
2. Import generated packages with correct module paths.
3. Run `go mod tidy` to synchronize dependencies.

### Problem: Queries Return Unexpected or No Results

**Cause:**
- Incorrect usage of generated field helpers or query APIs.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Validate your data seeding and migrations match expected data models.
2. Confirm your query parameters use generated predicates correctly, for example:

    ```go
    generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")
    ```

3. Review the [Using Your Generated APIs Guide](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-codegen/using-generated.mdx) for examples.

## 5. Debugging Tips & Tools

- Use the `DEBUG=true` environment variable to get verbose output during tests and operations.

  ```bash
  DEBUG=true go test ./...
  ```

- Enable GORM debug mode in your app to log SQL queries:

  ```go
  db = db.Debug()
  ```

- Check the `scripts/test_all.sh` script for running all tests and verifying environment setup is consistent.

- Inspect example test setups in `examples/output/test_helpers_test.go` for best practices.

---

## 6. Getting Further Help

- Review the [Installation](../getting-started/setup-basics/installation.md) and [Project Setup](../getting-started/first-codegen/project-setup.md) guides.
- Use the [GORM CLI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) to search issues or raise questions.
- Join community forums and GORM's discussion channels for live support.

## Summary
When facing issues during your GORM CLI setup, systematically check your Go environment, installation paths, and configuration files. Ensure your SQL templates are syntactically correct and your generation commands include required flags. Utilize debug environment variables and example test code to verify system health. If problems persist, consult related documentation or community resources for assistance.
