# Install the GORM CLI

This page provides a clear, step-by-step guide to install the GORM CLI command-line tool using the recommended `go install` method, along with helpful tips for different user environments. By following these instructions, you will have the GORM CLI ready to generate type-safe, fluent query APIs for your Go projects using GORM.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing the GORM CLI, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Go version 1.18 or later**: The GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in 1.18.
- **Go environment properly set up**: Your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` should be configured so the installed binary can be found in your system's PATH.
- **Network access**: You need internet connectivity to download the CLI package from the module repository.

If you need to verify your Go version, run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```plaintext
go version go1.20.3 darwin/amd64
```


## 2. Installation Instructions

The recommended way to install GORM CLI is with the `go install` command, which downloads and installs the binary to your Go bin directory.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install GORM CLI">
Run the following command to install the latest version:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This compiles and places the `gorm` executable in your Go binary directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation">
After installation, confirm the CLI is accessible:

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see the CLI version printed without errors.

If you see "command not found", make sure your Go bin directory is added to your system PATH.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Adding GORM CLI to Your PATH

If the `gorm` command is not found after installation, you need to add the Go binary directory to your PATH environment variable.

- **Linux/macOS (bash/zsh)**

  Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

  Then reload your shell configuration:

  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**

  Add the Go bin folder to your PATH:

  ```powershell
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $Env:Path + ";" + "$(go env GOPATH)\\bin", "User")
  ```

  Then restart your terminal.

## 4. Alternative Installation Methods

If `go install` is not suitable, here are some alternatives:

- **Download prebuilt binaries**

  Currently, GORM CLI does not provide official prebuilt binaries. Use `go install`.

- **Compile from source**

  Clone the repository and build manually:

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.git
cd cli/gorm
go build -o gorm ./cmd/gorm
```

  Then move the binary to a directory in your PATH.

> Note: This method is advanced and usually unnecessary.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">

- Confirm Go binaries path:

  ```bash
go env GOPATH
  ```

- Check if `$GOPATH/bin/gorm` exists.
- Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your PATH as shown above.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">

- If running `go version` shows less than 1.18, upgrade Go to latest stable version.
- Download from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Issues During Installation">

- Check your internet connection and proxy settings.
- Try running:

  ```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  ```

- Retry `go install`.

## 6. Next Steps

Once you have successfully installed the `gorm` CLI command, you are ready to:

- Define your query interfaces and model structs in your Go project.
- Generate your first set of type-safe query APIs with `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated`.
- Explore [Prepare Your Project](../first-usage-configuration/project-structure) to organize your codebase.
- Learn more about running your first generation [Quickstart & Main Workflow](../../overview/architecture-workflows-integration/quickstart-and-primary-workflow).
