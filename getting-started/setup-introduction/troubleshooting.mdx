# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

When setting up GORM CLI, some users may run into common issues related to prerequisites, installation paths, or environment configuration. This guide focuses on identifying these problems early and providing clear, effective solutions to ensure a smooth start.

---

## 1. Common Installation & Setup Problems

### 1.1 Go Toolchain Not Found or Version Too Low

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to its reliance on generics.

**Symptoms:**
- `command not found: go` error
- Installation fails with version compatibility errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify Go is installed and available in your `PATH`:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output: `go version go1.18 ...` or higher.

2. If Go is missing or outdated:
   - Download and install the latest Go from https://golang.org/dl/
   - Restart your terminal to apply PATH changes.

<Warning>
Using a Go version below 1.18 will cause the GORM CLI installation or runtime to fail. Always check your Go version before proceeding.
</Warning>

### 1.2 `gorm` Command Not Found After Installation

After `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`, the binary may not be immediately accessible.

**Reason:** The Go bin directory may not be part of your system's `PATH`.

**Fix:**
1. Locate your Go binary install path:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

This outputs the base directory (e.g., `/Users/username/go`). The CLI binary will be in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.

2. Ensure this directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.

For example, add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

3. Reload your shell or restart your terminal:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
# or
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Confirm availability:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected: Display of CLI usage info.

<Note>
If you installed Go through a package manager like Homebrew, the Go bin path usually updates automatically. Verify nonetheless.
</Note>

### 1.3 Permission Denied During Installation

In some environments, you might encounter permissions errors when `go install` attempts to write binaries.

**Steps to resolve:**
1. Check permissions for your Go paths:

```bash
ls -ld $(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

2. If you lack write permission, adjust them or run the install with appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(go env GOPATH)/bin
# or
sudo go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

<Warning>
Avoid running `go install` with `sudo` unless absolutely necessary to prevent security risks.
</Warning>

---

### 1.4 Path Conflicts with Previous Versions or Other CLI Tools

If an older version of `gorm` or another CLI tool with the same name exists in your `PATH` earlier, the new install might be shadowed.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
which gorm
```

This shows the absolute path of the executable that will run.

**Action:** Ensure the Go `bin` directory appears before conflicting paths in your `PATH`. Adjust your shell profile accordingly.

### 1.5 Troubleshooting Docker or Database Connectivity Issues

If you use Docker Compose to stand up dependencies (e.g., MySQL), confirm:
- Containers are running
- Network ports are correctly mapped

Example for MySQL service mapping:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: 'mysql:latest'
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9910:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=gorm
      - MYSQL_USER=gorm
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=gorm
```

Confirm container status:

```bash
docker ps
```

Test connection to port 9910:

```bash
telnet 127.0.0.1 9910
```

If connection fails, troubleshoot Docker networking or firewall settings.

---

## 2. Diagnostic Commands and Validation

Use the following commands to diagnose and verify your setup:

```bash
# Check Go version
go version

# Check GORM CLI installation
gorm --help

gorm version

# Check GOPATH and bin folder
go env GOPATH
ls -l $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm

# Locate which gorm will run
which gorm

# Run a quick code generation test (assuming you have example interface and models set up)
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Expected results are no errors and generated code in the target output directory.

---

## 3. Best Practices for a Smooth Setup

- **Pre-check your environment**: Confirm Go 1.18+ and PATH setup before installation.
- **Follow CLI installation instructions exactly** from [Install the GORM CLI](https://gorm.io/cli/install-cli) guide.
- **Validate immediately after install** using `gorm --help` and a test generation run.
- **Keep environment consistent**: Avoid multiple Go versions conflicting, and clean outdated binaries.
