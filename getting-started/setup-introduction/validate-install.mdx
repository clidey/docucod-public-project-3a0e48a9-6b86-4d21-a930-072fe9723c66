# Validate Your Installation

Congratulations on installing the GORM CLI! This guide walks you through essential steps to verify that your CLI installation is correctly set up and fully operational. Performing these sanity checks early ensures you catch and resolve any configuration or environment issues before you begin generating query code.

---

## 1. Confirm CLI Installation

First, verify that the `gorm` CLI binary is available and accessible in your system's PATH.

### Steps

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
gorm --version
```

### Expected Outcome

- The CLI should print its version information, for example:
  
  ```
  GORM CLI Tool version vX.Y.Z
  ```

- If you see a 'command not found' or similar error, your installation or PATH is not configured properly.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure you followed the installation steps correctly ([Install the GORM CLI](../../getting-started/setup-introduction/install-cli)).
- Confirm that your `GOPATH/bin` or Go binary install location is in your PATH.
- Retry installation if necessary:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

## 2. Run a Basic Command

Test the CLI by running the built-in help command or listing available commands.

```bash
gor help
```

or

```bash
gor
```

You should see a summary of available commands such as `gen` for code generation.

---

## 3. Validate the Code Generator Setup

To ensure the generator works correctly, run it against a minimal sample interface with SQL annotations.

### Prepare a Sample Interface

Create a minimal Go interface file, e.g., `examples/query.go`, with this content:

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}
```

### Run the Generator

Use the CLI to generate code into a temporary directory:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./examples/output
```

### Expected Results

- The generator prints progress messages, like `Generating file ...`.
- Generated files appear in `examples/output`.

### Verify Generated Code

Open generated files and confirm they contain type-safe query methods corresponding to your interface.

---

## 4. Optional: Run Tests to Confirm Functionality

If you cloned the repository or have example tests, run them to validate functionality end-to-end.

From the root directory, execute:

```bash
go test ./examples/...
```

or with debug logs enabled:

```bash
DEBUG=true go test ./examples/...
```

### Expected Outcome

- Tests pass without errors, confirming that the GORM CLI-generated code and model setup work as expected.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
- Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or Go's bin directory is in your PATH environment variable.
- Restart your terminal session after installing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generator Fails to Run or Find Input Files">
- Verify the path to your interface file is correct.
- Confirm that the interface file contains the proper SQL template comments.
- Check you are running from the right working directory.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated Files Not Found or Empty">
- Confirm you specified the output folder with `-o`.
- Check file/directory write permissions.
- Review CLI output for errors or warnings.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Once you have validated your installation:

- Proceed to [Prepare Your Project](../first-usage-configuration/project-structure) to organize your models and interfaces.
- Follow [Generate Code: Your First Run](../first-usage-configuration/run-generator) to create your query APIs.
- Explore [Use the Generated APIs](../first-usage-configuration/using-generated-code) to integrate generated code.

---

## Summary
Validating your GORM CLI installation is a quick but crucial step that confirms your development environment is ready for seamless code generation. By running simple commands and generating sample code, you build confidence and prevent issues from derailing your workflow.
