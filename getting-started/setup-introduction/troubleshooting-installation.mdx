# Troubleshooting Installation

When installing GORM CLI, you may encounter common issues such as Go version incompatibility, missing CLI commands, or workspace path problems. This guide helps you swiftly identify and resolve these obstacles so you can continue your setup without interruption.

---

## 1. Verify Go Version Compatibility

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** because it depends on Go generics. An older Go version will cause installation failures or runtime errors.

### How to Check Your Go Version

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```

- **Expected result:** `go version go1.18 ...` or higher
- **If your version is lower:** Update your Go installation to version 1.18 or later.

### Updating Go

- **On Linux/macOS:**
  - Download from the official site: https://go.dev/dl/
  - Follow the installation instructions corresponding to your OS.

- **On Windows:**
  - Use the Microsoft Windows installer from the official Go site

<Tip>
Always verify your `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT` environment variables to make sure your shell uses the updated Go version.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

The recommended way to install GORM CLI is via the Go tooling using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### Common Issues During Installation

- **Command Not Found After Installation:**
  - This usually means your **`$GOPATH/bin`** or **`$HOME/go/bin`** directory is not in your system PATH.
  
  **How to fix:**
  - Add the Go bin path to your PATH:

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  # Or for typical default:
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
  ```

  - To persist this, add the export command to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)

- **Installation Errors About Network or Access:**
  - Check your network connectivity and proxy settings.
  - Ensure you can reach `gorm.io` and Go modules proxy.

---

## 3. Confirm CLI is Accessible

After installation, verify the CLI can be executed:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- **Expected output:** Usage instructions and available commands

If you see an error like "command not found":

- Double-check PATH setup (see above).
- Run the absolute path to the binary if needed:

```bash
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm --help
```

<Tip>
If you consistently face PATH issues, consider symlinking the binary to a directory already in PATH, e.g., `/usr/local/bin`.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Troubleshooting Specific Errors

### • "go: command not found"

- This means Go is not installed or not detected by your shell.
- Reinstall Go and ensure the `go` command is globally available.

### • "unknown revision latest"

- Sometimes caused by network issues or Go proxy unavailability.
- Retry installation or set `GOPROXY` explicitly:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

### • "flag provided but not defined"

- Indicates that a wrong or outdated version of the `gorm` CLI executable is running.
- Check for conflicting binaries in your PATH.

### • Permission Denied Errors during Installation

- Run installation commands with appropriate user rights.
- Avoid using `sudo` unless necessary.
- Make sure your Go workspace directories are writable.

## 5. Next Steps After Troubleshooting

Once the installation issues are resolved, proceed to:

1. **Prepare your Project & Quickstart**: Structure your Go project with your models and query interfaces.
2. **Run the CLI code generation**: Use the `gorm gen` command to generate your type-safe query APIs.
3. **Explore configuration options** for customizing output based on your project needs.
