# Install GORM CLI

This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool on your system using Go's tooling infrastructure. You'll find installation instructions for all supported platforms alongside verification commands to confirm your installation was successful.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Go version**: Go 1.18 or later (required for generics support)
- **System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Network**: Internet access for downloading the package

<Check>
Verify your Go installation and version:
```bash
go version
```
Expected output example:
```
go version go1.18 darwin/amd64
```
If your version is lower than 1.18, update Go before proceeding.
</Check>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

The GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module installable via the `go install` command.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the installation command">
Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the latest GORM CLI binary:
```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
This command downloads, compiles, and installs the `gorm` binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`).
</Step>
<Step title="Verify the binary location">
Make sure your Go binaries directory is in your system's `PATH` environment variable to access the CLI globally.

- On Linux/macOS, typically:
  ```bash
  export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
  ```

- On Windows, add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your PATH via system environment variables.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm installation">
Run the following command to confirm that GORM CLI is installed and accessible:
```bash
gorm --help
```
Expected output:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If the `gorm` command is not found, verify your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`, or use the full path to execute the binary.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS and Linux

- Ensure your shell's profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) exports the `$GOPATH/bin` path.

- Run `source ~/.bashrc` or equivalent after modification.

### Windows

- Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your User or System Environment Variables via Control Panel or PowerShell.
- Restart your terminal to apply changes.

---

## 4. Quick Validation Commands

To verify your installation fully works, try the following:

- Check version and help command:
```bash
gorm --help
```

- Access the `gen` command help to ensure subcommands are present:
```bash
gorm gen --help
```
Expected snippet:
```
Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces

Usage:
  gorm gen [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for gen
  -i, --input string   Path to Go interface file with raw SQL annotations (required)
  -o, --output string  Directory to place generated code (default "./g")
```

- Note the `--input` flag is required when running `gen` to specify the source Go interface.

<Tip>
Running just `gorm gen` without flags will return an error stating the `input` flag is required.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
- **Cause:** Go binaries directory not in `PATH`.
- **Solution:** Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your system `PATH` environment variable and restart your terminal.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
- **Cause:** Your Go version is below 1.18.
- **Solution:** Download and install the latest Go version from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
- **Cause:** Lack of write permissions to `GOPATH` or `$GOPATH/bin`.
- **Solution:** Adjust permissions or install with elevated privileges, or configure Go to use a writable directory.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Download Issues">
- **Cause:** Proxy or firewall blocking module downloads.
- **Solution:** Configure Go proxy settings or allow network access.
</Accordion>

## 6. Next Steps & Getting Started

Now that GORM CLI is installed:

- Proceed to [First Run & Quick Validation](/getting-started/setup-introduction/first-run) to try generating code with your own interfaces.
- Explore [Set Up Your Models & Query Interfaces](/getting-started/initial-usage/project-structure) to organize your project structure for smooth generation.
- Review [Generate Type-Safe APIs](/getting-started/initial-usage/basic-generation) for detailed guidance on code generation usage.

For additional help, see the [Troubleshooting & Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/initial-usage/troubleshooting) page.
