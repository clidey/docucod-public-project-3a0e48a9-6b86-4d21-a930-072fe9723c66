# Install GORM CLI

This guide provides you with clear, actionable steps to install the GORM CLI tool using Go tooling on your system. It ensures you verify the installation and confirm that the CLI is accessible from your terminal.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Requirements

Before installing, verify the following prerequisites to ensure a smooth setup:

- **Go Version**: You must have Go 1.18 or higher installed. GORM CLI uses Go generics introduced in 1.18.
- **Platform Support**: GORM CLI supports all major OS platforms where Go runs, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Go Environment Setup**: Ensure your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` environment variables are correctly configured so installed binaries are accessible from your terminal.

<Tip>
To check your Go installation and version, run:
```bash
go version
```
You should see output similar to `go version go1.18 ...` or higher.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

The recommended way to install GORM CLI is by using the standard `go install` command. This method fetches the latest stable release and installs the CLI binary into your Go environment's bin directory.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the install command">
Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This fetches the latest GORM CLI and installs the executable.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify binary path">
Ensure your Go bin directory is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

- Run:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

or on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
echo $Env:Path
```

- Confirm the Go bin directory, usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`, appears in the PATH.

If not, add it to your PATH so that the `gorm` command can be run from any terminal location.

</Step>
<Step title="Confirm installation">
Verify that the CLI is properly installed and accessible by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output includes usage instructions and a summary of the CLI commands such as `gen`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Command not found after installation">
- Confirm your Go bin directory is added to your PATH environment variable.
- Restart your terminal or shell session after modifying paths.
- Check where `go install` placed the binary:

```bash
ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
```

- Add this directory to your PATH if missing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is too old or not installed">
- Verify Go is installed correctly using `go version`.
- Download and install Go 1.18+ from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network issues during installation">
- Ensure your network allows outbound connections to `gorm.io` and related Git repositories.
- Try rerunning `go install` or use a VPN if behind restricted firewalls.

## 4. Validate Your GORM CLI Installation

Once installed, verify your GORM CLI is ready to use with these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the command:

```bash
gorm --help
```

3. Check that you see output similar to:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate type-safe APIs and field helpers
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```

4. You can now run commands like:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```
to explore the code generation options.

<Tip>Seeing the help output confirms that GORM CLI is correctly installed and your environment is properly set up.</Tip>

## 5. Next Steps

- After verifying installation, proceed to define your Go models and query interfaces as described in the [Prepare Your Project & Quickstart](../config-first-use/project-structure-and-quickstart) guide.
- Follow up with the [Generate Your First Code](../config-first-use/running-cli-generate) page to learn how to run the CLI for your first code generation.
- If you encounter any issues, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation](../setup-introduction/troubleshooting-installation) page for deeper diagnostics and resolutions.
