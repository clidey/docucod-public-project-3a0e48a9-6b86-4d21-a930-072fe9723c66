# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your system environment meets the necessary requirements to install and efficiently run GORM CLI. This page helps you verify compatibility and prepare your development setup for a seamless experience with GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GORM CLI is designed to run on platforms supported by Go 1.18 and later versions. This includes:

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Architectures:** amd64, arm64, and others supported by Go binaries

Verify your operating system version and hardware architecture are compatible with Go 1.18 or higher.

---

## 2. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI requires **Go version 1.18 or newer**. This minimum version is needed because GORM CLI leverages Go generics to provide compile-time safety and a fluent API.

### How to Check Your Go Version

Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output example:

```text
go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64
```

If your Go version is older than 1.18, you must upgrade before proceeding.

---

## 3. Dependency Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure you have the following:

- **Go Toolchain:** Installed and configured properly
- **GORM v2:** GORM CLI generates code designed to work seamlessly with `gorm.io/gorm` (version 2 or later). While GORM itself is not a direct dependency of the CLI tool installation, it is necessary for your project to use the generated APIs.

You do not need to install any other external software or databases to use GORM CLI itself.

---

## 4. Network & Environment Considerations

- **Internet access** is required to download GORM CLI during installation (`go install`).

- **Environment Variables:** Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your system PATH to enable running the `gorm` CLI command globally.

- **Firewall/Proxy:** If working behind a firewall or proxy, ensure Go tooling can access GitHub and `gorm.io` repositories.

---

## 5. Verifying Your Go Environment Compatibility

Follow these steps to confirm your Go environment supports GORM CLI:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go Installation and Version">
Run:

```bash
go version
```

Confirm version is 1.18 or later.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify GOPATH and Binary PATH">
Check GOPATH:

```bash
echo $GOPATH
```

Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or your Go bin directory is included in your system PATH.

On Unix-like systems:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

On Windows:

```powershell
echo $Env:PATH
```
</Step>
<Step title="Test Go Module Support">
Run any `go mod init` and `go build` commands inside your project to ensure Go modules are working.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 6. Common Prerequisite Pitfalls

<Tip>
- Using Go versions below 1.18 will cause installation errors or runtime failures due to the use of generics.
- Missing `$GOPATH/bin` in your PATH disables direct command execution of `gorm`.
- Code generation requires your Go code to use proper Go modules structure for imports.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not attempt to run GORM CLI without the necessary Go version or environment setup; you will encounter unexpected errors.
</Warning>

---

## 7. Summary Checklist Before Installation

Before installing or running GORM CLI, ensure:

- [ ] Operating system is supported (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Go runtime is version 1.18 or newer
- [ ] Go environment variables (`GOPATH`, PATH) are correctly configured
- [ ] Internet connection is available for downloading Go packages
- [ ] Your Go project uses GORM v2 or later to take advantage of generated code

---

## 8. Next Steps

Once you have verified the above prerequisites:

- Proceed to the [Install GORM CLI](/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation-instructions) page for detailed installation instructions.

- Familiarize yourself with the [Quickstart Workflow](/overview/feature-highlights-getting-started/quickstart-workflow) to understand how to define query interfaces and models for generation.

- If you encounter issues, consult the [Troubleshooting Installation](/getting-started/setup-introduction/troubleshooting-installation) guide.

## Practical Tip

To install GORM CLI after verifying prerequisites, run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Make sure you can run `gorm` in your terminal after installation:

```bash
gorm --help
```

If you see the help output, your environment is properly set up for GORM CLI.
