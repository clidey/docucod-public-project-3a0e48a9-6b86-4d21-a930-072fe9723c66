# First Run & Quick Validation

This guide helps you perform your first run of the GORM CLI tool to confirm that the installation succeeded and that the CLI is accessible and functional from your command line environment. Completing these quick tests ensures you can confidently proceed to generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Installation

Before running code generation, verify that the `gorm` command is accessible and the installed version is as expected.

### Step 1: Check CLI availability

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
gorm version
```

**Expected outcome:**

- You see the CLI version output (for example: `gorm version vX.Y.Z`) without errors.
- If you get a "command not found" or similar error, verify your Go `GOPATH/bin` or install path is in your system `PATH`.

<Tip>
If `gorm version` fails, ensure you have installed GORM CLI using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

and that `$GOPATH/bin` (or Go bin directory) is included in your system's PATH variable.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Basic CLI Command Test

Run the following command to check if the CLI command structure and help system are working:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

**Expected outcome:**

- CLI help text for the `gen` command is displayed, including available flags (`-i`, `-o`) and descriptions.

---

## 3. Prepare a Minimal Interface File for Generation

To run a quick test generation, create a simple `.go` file with a basic query interface.

### Example minimal interface (`testquery.go`):

```go
package test

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT 1
  Test() (int, error)
}
```

Place this file in a test directory (e.g., `./test`).

---

## 4. Run a Quick Generation

Execute the code generation command against your minimal interface.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./test -o ./test/generated
```

**What this does:**

- Reads the interface in `./test` folder.
- Generates code into `./test/generated`.

**Expected outcome:**

- No errors from the CLI.
- Generated code files appear in the specified output directory.

<Tip>
If you encounter errors like "no interfaces found" or file path issues:
- Verify the `-i` path points to the directory containing your interface files.
- Confirm your interfaces contain SQL comments as expected.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Verify Generated Code

Navigate to the generated directory:

```bash
ls ./test/generated
```

You should see Go source files containing generated query implementations and field helpers.

---

## 6. Run a Quick Build (Optional)

To ensure generated code compiles correctly, run:

```bash
go build ./test/generated
```

**Expected outcome:**

- No compilation errors.

This confirms the generator produced valid Go code.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found or Version Command Fails">
- Confirm `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` completed successfully.
- Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go binary directory is in your system PATH.
- Restart your terminal after changes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Interfaces Found Error">
- Verify the input directory path (`-i`) contains `.go` files with interfaces.
- Ensure your interfaces have correct SQL template comments.
- Confirm you are pointing to a package directory, not empty or outside the project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied When Writing Output">
- Check folder permissions for the output directory.
- Use a directory where you have write access, or run with appropriate privileges.
</Accordion>
