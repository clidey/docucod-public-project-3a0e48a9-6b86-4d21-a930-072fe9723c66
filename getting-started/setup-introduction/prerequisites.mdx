# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GORM CLI

Ensure your development environment is ready before installing and using GORM CLI. Addressing these prerequisites upfront will help you avoid common setup issues and get productive with generating type-safe GORM query APIs and model-driven helpers without delays.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

- GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later**.
- Go 1.18+ is mandatory because it uses Go generics extensively.

> Attempting to run GORM CLI with an older Go version will result in errors or incompatibility.

**How to verify your installed Go version:**

```bash
go version
```

Expected output example:

```
go version go1.20.3 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, please upgrade following the official Go installation instructions: https://golang.org/doc/install

---

## 2. Environment Dependencies

- **GORM CLI** is a standalone command-line tool built in Go.
- It does not depend on additional software beyond:
  - A compatible Go toolchain (with `go` command available in PATH).
  - The GORM library and its dependencies, which are automatically managed by Go modules.

You do *not* need a database installed on your development machine to generate code. The generator works from your Go interfaces and models only.

---

## 3. System Requirements

While GORM CLI is lightweight, ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements:

| Component     | Minimum Spec                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Operating System | Any OS supported by Go 1.18+ (Linux, macOS, Windows) |
| RAM           | 2 GB or more                   |
| Disk Space    | Minimum 100 MB free for installation and generated code output |
| Network       | Internet connection to install GORM CLI via `go install`            |

The tool runs on all major platforms that Go supports. For Windows users, PowerShell or CMD are supported shells.

---

## 4. Access & Permissions

- You must have:
  - Access to a terminal or command prompt with execution permissions.
  - The ability to install Go packages globally (or use module-aware environment).
  - Write permissions to the folder where you intend to generate code using the `-o` option of GORM CLI.

**Tip:** Avoid using system-protected directories (e.g., root of system drives) for code generation output.

---

## 5. Network and Proxy Settings

- Installation requires internet access to download `gorm.io/cli/gorm` module.
- If behind a proxy or firewall, ensure the `go` tool can access external Git repos.

**Possible failure symptoms:**
- `go install` hangs or errors out referencing network or Git fetch issues.

**Solution:**
- Configure your Go proxy environment variables such as `GOPROXY`.
- Consult your network administrator if needed.

---

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

Follow these steps to confirm your environment is ready:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go Installation and Version">
Run:
```bash
go version
```
You should see a Go version >= 1.18.
If not, update your Go toolchain.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Module Support">
Create a simple Go project and run:
```bash
go mod init testmodule
```
to ensure your workspace supports Go modules.
</Step>
<Step title="Install GORM CLI">
Run:
```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
Confirm that `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your PATH.
</Step>
<Step title="Run GORM CLI Version Check">
Verify installation:
```bash
gorm --help
```
The CLI should display usage information.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI not found after installation">
Make sure your Go bin directory is in your PATH environment variable.
- Add `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` to your PATH.
- Restart your terminal after this change.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version is lower than 1.18">
Upgrade Go to the latest stable version.
Older versions do not support the generic features required by GORM CLI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or proxy errors when installing CLI">
Configure your network proxy settings for Go:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

Or set your corporate proxy environment variables.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied when generating code">
Run the code generation command in a directory where you have write access.
Avoid protected system or root directories.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Preparing your development environment with Go 1.18+, ensuring the availability of Go modules, and installing GORM CLI properly are the essential first steps. This avoids setup hiccups and lets you focus on generating and using your type-safe query APIs easily.

Once you have confirmed these prerequisites, proceed to the [Install GORM CLI](/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation) page to perform the actual installation and initial setup.
