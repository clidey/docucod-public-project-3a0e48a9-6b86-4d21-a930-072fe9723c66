# Quickstart: Your First Code Generation

Welcome to your hands-on introduction to GORM CLI! This guide is designed to get you up and running with your first code generation in just a few minutes. You'll learn how to write a simple query interface and model, run the code generator CLI, and use the generated APIs to run queries and updates. By following these steps, you'll validate your environment and gain confidence in how GORM CLI seamlessly integrates with your Go and GORM projects.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

### Prerequisites
- **Go version 1.18 or higher** installed. GORM CLI requires Go generics.
- GORM dependency available in your Go project.
- Basic understanding of Go interfaces and structs.

<Tip>
If you havenâ€™t installed Go yet, download it from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

### Confirm Your Go Environment
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output should show Go 1.18 or later.

---

## 2. Install GORM CLI

Run the following command to install the CLI tool globally:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### Verify Installation
Check that the `gorm` command is available:

```bash
gorm --help
```
You should see CLI usage instructions.

<Warning>
If you get "command not found", ensure $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin is in your PATH.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Write Your First Query Interface & Model

GORM CLI generates your type-safe query APIs from interfaces annotated with raw SQL templates, and field helpers from model structs.

Create a directory (e.g., `examples/`) and add the following files:

### Create the Query Interface (e.g., `examples/query.go`)

```go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

### Create the Model Struct (e.g., `examples/models/user.go`)

```go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

This sets the foundation:
- `Query[T]` describes typed query operations with SQL templates.
- `User` is a GORM model defining your database schema.

---

## 4. Run the Code Generator

Use the CLI tool to generate your query APIs and field helpers.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i ./examples` points to the input directory containing your interfaces/models.
- `-o ./generated` specifies output directory for generated code.

### What to Expect
The CLI will parse your Go code, extract interfaces with SQL annotations, generate type-safe APIs, and field helpers based on your model structs.

A success message like:

```
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

confirms code generation.

<Warning>
If you encounter errors:
- Ensure your SQL annotations are correctly formatted.
- Verify Go code compiles properly.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Using the Generated Code

The generated code exposes convenient, type-safe APIs to query and update your database.

### Example Usage (in your Go code)

```go
import (
  "context"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "yourmodule/generated" // replace with your module path
  "yourmodule/examples/models"
)

func runExample(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Query the user by ID
  u, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Fetch users where age and name match filters
  err = generated.Query[models.User](db).
    FilterByNameAndAge("jinzhu", 25).
    Find(ctx, &users)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  return nil
}
```

This shows:
- `Query[User](db)` returns the generated Query interface implementation.
- Methods like `.GetByID(ctx, id)` run safe, templated SQL queries.

---

## 6. Validate & Troubleshoot

Make sure everything works as expected.

### Success Indicators
- Generated files appear in your output directory.
- Your Go code compiles and runs using the generated APIs.
- Queries return expected data.

### Common Issues & Fixes

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found or 'gorm' Not Recognized">
Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is added to your system PATH environment variable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Syntax Errors in Generated Code">
Check your SQL template comments in the interface for formatting issues or unescaped special characters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Output Generated or Empty Files">
Verify your input path and interface annotations are correct. Ensure methods have proper return types.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Database Connection Errors at Runtime">
Confirm your GORM `*gorm.DB` instance is correctly configured and connected to your database.

# Quick Commands Summary

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
$ go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Generate code (replace ./examples with your folder)
$ gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Use generated code in your Go application
```


# Practical Tips
- Keep query interfaces and models in the same package for easiest generation.
- Use `@@table` placeholder in SQL templates to refer to model tables.
- Write clean, descriptive SQL comments above interface methods to drive code generation.
- Validate your Go code compiles before running generation.
- Enable verbose logging in your app to check generated SQL in runtime.


# Common Pitfall to Avoid
- Forgetting to add `error` as the last return value in interface methods that return data.
- Writing SQL template comments without proper binding syntax like `@param` and `@@table`.
- Running the generator with wrong or missing input path.
