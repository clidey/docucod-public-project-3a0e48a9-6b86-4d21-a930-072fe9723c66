# System Requirements for GORM CLI

Ensure your development environment meets the necessary prerequisites before using GORM CLI. This page guides you through supported Go versions, essential dependencies, and toolchain considerations to guarantee a smooth and successful code generation experience.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

GORM CLI requires **Go version 1.18 or newer** to function correctly.

- This is primarily due to the CLI's reliance on Go generics introduced in Go 1.18.
- Verify your Go version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```plaintext
go version go1.18 darwin/amd64
```

If your version is older, upgrade your Go installation before proceeding with GORM CLI.

<Check>
Always use Go 1.18 or later to take full advantage of type-safe and generic features GORM CLI depends on.
</Check>

---

## 2. Key Dependencies

To use GORM CLI, your project must satisfy a few major dependencies:

- **gorm.io/gorm**: GORM CLI is built to extend GORM projects, so your Go modules must include `gorm.io/gorm`.
  - Make sure you have added the GORM dependency in your `go.mod`:

  ```bash
  go get gorm.io/gorm
  ```

- **GORM CLI itself**: You need to install the CLI tool globally or locally to generate code.

  Install via:

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```

- **Other tools**: The CLI uses `github.com/spf13/cobra` for command execution internally, but you do not need to install this separately.

<Note>
Your projectâ€™s Go module should be properly initialized with `go mod init` and dependencies managed via `go mod tidy` to avoid module conflicts.
</Note>

---

## 3. Environment Setup Considerations

- **Operating systems supported**:
  - GORM CLI supports all major platforms Go supports (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **File system permissions**:
  - Ensure you have write permissions to generate code in the output directory (default is `./g`).
- **Network access**:
  - Required for fetching dependencies using Go modules.

---

## 4. Toolchain Configuration

- **Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system PATH** so you can run the `gorm` CLI command directly after installation.

- Verify installation with:

  ```bash
  gorm --help
  ```

- The CLI tool expects Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates, which means you need to have your model and query interface source files properly structured.

## 5. Summary of System Requirements

| Requirement            | Details                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Go Version             | 1.18 or later            |
| GORM Dependency        | `gorm.io/gorm`           |
| CLI Installation       | `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` |
| Write Permissions      | Output directories writable |
| Supported OS           | Linux, macOS, Windows    |

## 6. Verifying Your Setup

Verify your environment readiness with the following checklist:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Go version">
    Run `go version` and confirm it reports 1.18 or later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify GORM dependency">
    Ensure your project includes `gorm.io/gorm` in `go.mod`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm `gorm` CLI installation">
    Run `gorm --help` and see the CLI help description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test write access">
    Try generating code with `gorm gen` command into your desired output folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If any step fails, refer to the Troubleshooting section.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Is Outdated">
Update Go to version 1.18 or newer. Visit [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/) to download the latest release.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm` Command Not Found After Installation">
Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` (default GOPATH) is in your system PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Restart your terminal or run the export command in your shell profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Conflicts or Missing Modules">
Run `go mod tidy` to clean your module dependencies.

If errors persist, check your network connectivity or proxy settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Writing Generated Files">
Verify that the directory you specify with `-o` flag has write permissions.

Change permissions or select another directory.

## 8. Next Steps

Once system requirements are met:

- Proceed to the [Installation Guide](../installation) to install and set up GORM CLI.
- Review the [Quick Start Guide](../first-code-generation) to generate your first type-safe query code.
