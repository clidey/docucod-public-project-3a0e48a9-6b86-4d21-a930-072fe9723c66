# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

Follow these step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool on your system. GORM CLI is platform-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with Go projects, making setup straightforward with just one command.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you install GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Go version:** GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** to support generics.
- **GORM dependency:** Your project should have GORM (`gorm.io/gorm`) already added as a dependency.
- **Environment:** Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
- **Network:** Internet access to download the CLI package.

<Check>
Make sure your Go environment is properly set up by running:
```bash
go version
```
You should see output indicating Go 1.18+.
</Check>

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

### 2.1. Using Go Install (Recommended)

The simplest way to install is via the `go install` command.

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command downloads and installs the CLI into your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`).
- Ensure this directory is included in your system's PATH environment variable to run `gorm` directly from the command line.

<Check>
Verify installation by checking the version (once CLI is in your PATH):
```bash
gorm --help
```
This should print usage information without errors.
</Check>

### 2.2. Alternative Installation Methods

Currently, GORM CLI is designed to be installed via Go tooling. There are no official binary releases or containerized versions.

---

## 3. Post-installation Verification

Confirm GORM CLI is correctly installed and accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- You should see a list of commands including `gen`, which generates code from interfaces.
- If the command is not found, verify your PATH environment variable includes Go’s bin directory.

<Tip>
If `gorm` command is not recognized:
- Check where `go install` placed the binary by running:
  ```bash
  go env GOPATH
  ```
- Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`. For example, on Unix:
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```
- Restart your terminal after updating PATH.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Installation Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Go Version Too Low

**Symptom:** `go install` fails or generated code won’t compile due to missing generics support.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to Go version 1.18 or newer.
- Check Go version with `go version`.

### Issue: `gorm` Command Not Found

**Symptom:** `gorm --help` returns 'command not found'.

**Solution:**
- Ensure Go’s bin folder is in your system PATH.
- Run `go env GOPATH` and add `$GOPATH/bin` to PATH environment variable.

### Issue: Network or Proxy Errors During Installation

**Symptom:** Installation fails with connection errors.

**Solution:**
- Verify internet connectivity.
- Check firewall or proxy that might block Go module downloads.
- Try configuring Go proxy with:
  ```bash
  go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  ```

## 5. Next Steps

After installation, proceed to generate your first code by defining your interfaces and model structs. See the [Quickstart: Your First Code Generation](getting-started/essential-setup/quickstart-your-first-generation) for detailed guidance.

- [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you encounter problems.

Explore the CLI commands:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

This command shows how to generate typed query APIs and field helpers using your Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates.

## Summary
- Install GORM CLI using `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Make sure Go 1.18+ is installed and your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.
- Verify installation with `gorm --help`.
- Troubleshoot common issues related to Go version, PATH, or network.
- Proceed to quickstart guides for generating and using your first APIs.
