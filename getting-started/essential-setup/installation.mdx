# Installation

Follow these clear, actionable steps to install the GORM CLI tool on your system using Go's tooling. This guide covers installation across all major platforms and includes troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth setup experience.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

- **Go Version:** Ensure you have Go 1.18 or later installed, as GORM CLI requires generics support.
- **Operating System:** Supported on all major platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Go Environment:** $GOPATH and $PATH should be configured correctly for `go install` to work.
- **Internet Access:** Required to download the module during installation.

**Verify your Go version:**

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your version is older, please update Go before proceeding.

## 2. Installation Instructions

The GORM CLI can be installed easily with Go's standard install command.

### Step 1: Install GORM CLI

Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command will download and compile the CLI tool, and place the executable into your $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN directory.

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Make sure the installation was successful by checking the CLI version:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output (version may vary):

```
gorm version vX.Y.Z
```

If the command is not found, make sure your $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN is in your system's PATH environment variable.

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

- Ensure your PATH includes your Go bin directory, typically `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`.
- You may need to restart your terminal or system for PATH changes to apply.

### macOS / Linux

- Your Go bin is typically `$HOME/go/bin`.
- Add it to your PATH by adding the following to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

- Reload your shell profile or restart the terminal after editing.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">

<Accordion title="Command not found after installation">

- Confirm your Go bin directory is in your PATH.
- Run `echo $PATH` (macOS/Linux) or `echo %PATH%` (Windows) to check.
- Add the Go bin directory manually if missing.
- Restart your terminal after changes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is too old or missing">

- Verify your Go version with `go version`.
- Download and install the latest Go from https://go.dev/dl/.
- After installation, confirm new version is active.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Installation fails with network errors">

- Check your internet connection.
- Ensure no firewall or proxy is blocking `go` commands.
- Try running `go clean -modcache` to clear module cache and retry.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied errors on `go install`">

- Run the terminal or command prompt with elevated privileges if needed.
- On Unix-like systems, verify you have write permissions for Go bin directory.
