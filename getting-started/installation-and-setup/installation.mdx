# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

This section provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI using Go's package manager. It includes platform-specific tips, best practices for a successful setup, and how to verify your installation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or later (generics support is required).
- **Operating Systems Supported:** Linux, macOS, Windows.
- **Go Toolchain:** The official Go toolchain must be installed and accessible via the terminal.

<Tip>
Verify your Go installation by running:

```bash
go version
```

Ensure the version is 1.18 or higher.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI Using `go install`

The recommended way to install GORM CLI is via the `go install` command, which fetches the latest release and installs the CLI binary in your Go binary path.

### Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the Install Command">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads, compiles, and installs the latest version of GORM CLI.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify your PATH">
Ensure that your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is included in your system’s PATH environment variable.

Run:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If it’s not included, add it following your OS-specific instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Installation">
After installation, verify that the `gorm` command is available by checking its version:

```bash
gorm --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
GORM CLI Tool version x.y.z
```

This confirms the CLI is installed and ready to use.
</Step>

</Steps>

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows:** PowerShell or Command Prompt should be restarted after installation for PATH changes to take effect.

- **macOS/Linux:** If your shell does not immediately recognize the `gorm` command, refresh your shell environment:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc depending on your shell
```

- If `go install` fails due to permissions or network issues, ensure your Go environment variables are correctly set and your internet connectivity is stable.

## 3. Best Practices for Installation

- **Use the Latest Version:** Always install with `@latest` to get the newest features and bug fixes.

- **Maintain Go Toolchain:** Keep your Go version up to date, as older versions lack generics support required by GORM CLI.

- **Environment Isolation:** For complex projects or multiple Go versions, consider using tools like `gvm` or Docker containers.

- **Security:** Install GORM CLI only from the official module path (`gorm.io/cli/gorm`) to avoid untrusted copies.

## 4. Verifying the Installation

Once installed, the easiest way to verify your GORM CLI installation is by running the version command.

```bash
gorm --version
```

Expected output should include the CLI name and version number, confirming the executable is accessible.

If this command fails or reports "command not found," revisit the PATH configuration.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="`gorm` command not found">
Ensure the Go bin directory is in your PATH. For example:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Add this line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`). Then restart your terminal or reload the shell.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
Upgrade your Go installation to version 1.18 or higher. Check your current version with:

```bash
go version
```

Download the latest version from [Go official site](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied during installation">
Ensure you have write permission to your Go bin directory. Avoid using `sudo` with `go install` as it can cause permission conflicts.

Alternatively, set the `GOBIN` environment variable to a directory you own:

```bash
export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin
```

Then install again.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or proxy issues during `go install`">
Verify your internet connection and any proxy settings.

Set Go proxy if necessary:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

Then retry installing.

## 6. Next Steps After Installation

- Proceed to write your first query interfaces and models as guided in the [Defining Models & Query Interfaces](https://docs.example.com/getting-started/your-first-code-generation/defining-models-interfaces) page.

- Generate your initial code using the `gorm gen` command.

- Explore the [Usage Guide](https://docs.example.com/guides/core-workflows/using-generated-apis) to integrate generated APIs into your projects.
