# System Requirements

Prepare your development environment to use the GORM CLI with confidence. This page outlines the minimum supported Go version, compatible operating systems, and essential dependencies you must have before installing or running GORM CLI. Ensuring your system meets these requirements will help you avoid common setup issues and focus quickly on generating type-safe, fluent APIs with GORM.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

- **Minimum Go version:** 1.18

GORM CLI uses Go generics extensively, which were introduced in Go 1.18. Ensure your Go installation is version 1.18 or higher to build and run GORM CLI successfully.

```bash
# Check your Go version
$ go version
# Expected output example: go version go1.19 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, update it from https://golang.org/dl/ before proceeding.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is a Go tool and supports all platforms officially supported by Go 1.18+, including:

- Linux (all major distributions)
- macOS
- Windows

The installation steps are consistent across platforms as long as Go is installed and configured properly.

---

## 3. Key Dependencies

- **Go Toolchain:** You must have Go installed and your GOPATH and GOROOT configured as per official Go guidelines.

- **GORM Framework:** GORM CLI generates code that integrates with `gorm.io/gorm`. You don't need GORM installed globally but your project using the generated code must import and use GORM.

- **Git (Optional but Recommended):**
  To easily install GORM CLI and fetch its source code for debugging or customization, having Git installed is recommended.

- **MySQL for Testing (Optional):**
  If you want to run the example tests or verify integration, ensure a MySQL server is accessible (like the example configuration binds MySQL to localhost:9910).

---

## 4. Environment Preparation Checklist

<Check>
- Go 1.18 or higher installed and accessible on your PATH
- Operating system supported by your Go installation
- GOPATH and GOROOT environment variables set correctly
- (Optional) Git installed for cloning the repo or installing via `go install`
- (Optional) MySQL or other supported databases setup for running tests or examples
</Check>

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Requirements">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
You see an error during installation or execution mentioning unsupported Go version.

**Solution:**
- Confirm your installed Go version with `go version`.
- Upgrade to Go 1.18 or later by downloading the newest release from https://golang.org/dl/.
- Make sure your shell PATH is updated to point to the new Go installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Go Environment Variables">
Installation or runtime errors complain about missing GOPATH or GOROOT.

**Solution:**
- Confirm environment variables:

  ```bash
  echo $GOPATH
  go env GOROOT
  ```

- Follow official Go installation instructions to set them up.
- On Windows, check system environment variables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unsupported Operating System">
You are trying to run GORM CLI on an OS not officially supported by Go 1.18+.

**Solution:**
- Confirm your operating system compatibility with Go from https://golang.org/doc/install.
- Use a supported OS such as Linux, macOS, or Windows for best results.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database Not Available for Examples or Tests">
The provided examples or tests require access to a MySQL database (default at 127.0.0.1:9910).

**Solution:**
- Use the included `compose.yml` to launch a local MySQL docker container:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f compose.yml up -d mysql
  ```

- Alternatively, adjust your test environment to connect to an existing MySQL server.
</Accordion>
