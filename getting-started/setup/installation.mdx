# Install the GORM CLI

This guide provides simple, copy-paste instructions to install the GORM CLI tool using Go modules on different platforms. Follow these steps to get the CLI installed and verify your setup quickly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing the GORM CLI, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Go version:** 1.18 or higher (to support Go generics).
- **Go environment:** Properly configured `GOPATH` and Go modules support.

If you haven't installed Go or need to verify your version, run:

```bash
go version
```

> The CLI requires Go 1.18+ for generics-based code generation features.


## 2. Installation Instructions

Use the Go `install` command to download and install the latest version of the GORM CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches the CLI source from the official module and installs the executable into your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

### Platform Notes

- **Linux / macOS:** This command works natively in your terminal.
- **Windows:** Use PowerShell or Command Prompt. Make sure your Go bin directory is added to the system PATH to run `gorm` from any location.

### Post-Installation

After installation, the `gorm` executable should be available in your shell. If you see 'command not found', verify your Go bin directory is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent) for persistence.


## 3. Verification

Confirm that the GORM CLI is correctly installed by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output summary:

- Usage info for `gorm` commands
- Description: "GORM CLI Tool"
- Available commands such as `gen` for code generation

Example snippet:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```

If this output appears without errors, the CLI is installed successfully and ready to use.


## 4. Next Steps

After installation, you can begin integrating GORM CLI in your projects:

- Write your query interfaces and model structs.
- Use the CLI `gen` command to generate type-safe query APIs and field helpers.

Basic code generation example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./path/to/generated
```

- Refer to the [Create Models and Query Interfaces](#) and [Generate Code with the CLI](#) guides in the documentation for detailed steps.

Ensure your Go bin directory is in your system PATH. Run:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Restart your terminal or re-source your shell profile.

Check your network connectivity to `gorm.io` and proxy settings. You can also try clearing Go module cache:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

<Accordion title="Windows Permission or PATH Issues">  
Run PowerShell as Administrator and verify environment PATH includes your Go bin folder. Restart terminal after changes.

## Additional Tips

- You can find the official repository and source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli).
- To stay updated, periodically re-run the `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` command.
- The CLI supports configuration flags; explore them with `gorm gen --help`.

---

## Summary

By following these simple, verified steps, you will have the GORM CLI installed and ready to generate type-safe query code in your Go projects.
