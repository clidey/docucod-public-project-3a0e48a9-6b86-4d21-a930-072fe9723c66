# Installing GORM CLI

This guide provides you with clear, step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI binary using the Go toolchain. You will be able to quickly obtain the latest version and verify the installation so you can start generating type-safe database query code for your Go projects.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later is required, as GORM CLI relies on generics introduced in this version.
- **Go Environment Setup**: Your `$GOPATH/bin` directory should be in your system `PATH` to run the installed CLI tool directly.

> If you don’t have Go installed, download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

---

## 2. Installation
The recommended way to install the GORM CLI is by using the `go install` command, which downloads and installs the latest release directly to your Go binary path.

### Step-by-step installation command:

```bash
# Install the latest GORM CLI version

go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### What happens here?
- `go install` fetches the package from the official module proxy.
- It compiles the CLI tool and places the binary into `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin` by default).


---

## 3. Verifying the Installation
After installation completes, verify that the CLI is correctly installed and accessible.

### Steps to verify:

1. **Check the binary is in your PATH:**

   ```bash
   which gorm
   ```

   This command should return the full path to the installed `gorm` binary. If it doesn’t, ensure your Go bin directory is in your system PATH.

2. **Display the CLI help:**

   ```bash
   gorm --help
   ```

   Expected output should show the help usage summary similar to this:

   ```
   GORM CLI Tool

   Usage:
       gorm [command]

   Available Commands:
       gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
       help        Help about any command

   Flags:
       -h, --help   help for gorm

   Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
   ```

> If you see the above, the CLI is installed successfully.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation">
<Accordion title="gorm: command not found after installation">
Make sure your Go binary directory is added to your system `PATH` environment variable.

By default, this is:
- Linux/macOS: `$HOME/go/bin`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`

For example, add this to your shell profile:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

Then restart your terminal or source the profile.

<Accordion title="Go version is older than 1.18">
Check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If the version is less than 1.18, upgrade your Go installation to meet the minimum requirement.

<Accordion title="Build or network errors during `go install`">
- Verify your internet connection and module proxy.
- Run:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

Then retry install.
- Check for firewall or proxy issues blocking Go module downloads.

## 5. Next Steps
After installing and verifying the GORM CLI, you are ready to:

- Define your query interfaces and model structs.
- Generate type-safe APIs using the `gorm gen` command.
- Integrate the generated code with your GORM-based Go applications.

For detailed guidance, proceed to the [Quickstart Workflow guide](/overview/integration-getting-started/quickstart-workflow) or explore [Project Setup & Model Definition](/getting-started/configuration/project-setup).

---

## Summary
- Install GORM CLI with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Ensure Go version ≥ 1.18.
- Verify by running `gorm --help`.
- Troubleshoot common PATH and version issues.
- Begin defining your interfaces and generating code with `gorm gen`.

<Tip>
Keeping your Go toolchain up to date ensures smooth installation and compatibility with GORM CLI features.
