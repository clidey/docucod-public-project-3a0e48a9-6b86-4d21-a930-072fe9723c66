# Prerequisites & Requirements

Prepare your development environment to fully leverage GORM CLI's powerful, type-safe code generation capabilities. This guide ensures you meet all essential version, dependency, and environment conditions that guarantee smooth setup and effective use of GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in Go 1.18. Therefore:

- **You must use Go version 1.18 or later**.
- Older Go versions will not compile or support the generic-based APIs GORM CLI generates.

Check your Go version with:

```bash
go version
```

If your version is earlier than 1.18, upgrade Go before proceeding.

---

## 2. Required Dependencies

GORM CLI depends chiefly on:

- **Go Modules**: For managing dependencies.
- **GORM (gorm.io/gorm)**: The ORM framework your project uses.
- **gorm.io/cli/gorm**: The CLI tool itself, installed via Go’s install mechanism.

### Installing GORM CLI

Install the latest version of the CLI tool globally with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches and installs the CLI in your `$GOPATH/bin`, enabling the `gorm` command.

### Verifying GORM CLI Install

Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see a list of available commands, including `gen` for code generation.

---

## 3. Environment Setup and Access Requirements

- **Go Module Initialization**: Your project should use Go modules (`go.mod` present). If not, initialize with:

```bash
go mod init your-module-name
```

- **Write Permissions**: Ensure you have write access to the directory where generated code will be stored (default is `./g`).

- **GORM-Compatible Database**: GORM CLI generates Go code that integrates with GORM. Your database setup (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) should be ready and compatible with GORM.

- **Database Drivers**: Make sure your project imports the required GORM dialect driver for your database.

---

## 4. General Compatibility Notes

- GORM CLI is designed for projects making use of GORM. It integrates tightly by generating code that calls `gorm.G[T]` and related type-safe APIs.
 - If your project does not use GORM ORM, much of the CLI-generated code will not function as intended.

- Custom field helpers and configurations may require additional packages or setup (e.g., SQL drivers, custom field types).

---

## 5. Recommended Tools

To maximize productivity and avoid common pitfalls, have the following tools installed:

- **An IDE with Go support** (e.g., GoLand, VSCode with Go plugin) for code navigation and autocompletion.
- **Git**, to clone/update from https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.

# Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation & Environment Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">

If `go version` shows a version less than 1.18:

- Upgrade Go from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
- After installation, re-check the version.
- Ensure your IDE and shell session picks the updated Go binary.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM CLI Command Not Found">

- Confirm that your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory is in your system `PATH`.
- After installing with `go install`, you may need to restart your terminal or add the path manually.
- Verify installation with `which gorm` (Linux/macOS) or `where gorm` (Windows).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Modules Not Enabled">

- Run `go mod init` in your project root if no `go.mod` file exists.
- Run `go mod tidy` to ensure dependencies are resolved.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Write Permission Errors">

- Check directory permissions where the generated code output folder is located.
- Use `chmod` or system tools to grant write access.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Next Steps

Once all prerequisites are met, proceed to:

- **Install the GORM CLI**: [Install the GORM CLI](/getting-started/setup/installation)
- **Write your query interfaces and model structs**: [Create Models and Query Interfaces](/getting-started/project-initialization/first-query-interface)
- **Generate code with the CLI**: [Generate Code with the CLI](/getting-started/project-initialization/run-generator)

These steps will guide you to create your first type-safe query APIs and field helpers.
