# Prerequisites & Requirements

Prepare your development environment to seamlessly use **GORM CLI**, a powerful code generation tool that enhances your GORM projects with type-safe query APIs and model-based field helpers. This chapter guides you through the essential technical prerequisites, system requirements, dependencies, and recommendations necessary before installing and running GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

- **Minimum Go Version:** Go 1.18 or newer
- **Reason:** GORM CLI relies on Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, to generate type-safe, generic query APIs.

Ensure you have Go 1.18+ installed and your `go` command is accessible in your terminal.

### Verify Go Version

```bash
go version
# Expected output: go version go1.18 ... or higher
```

<Tip>
Upgrading to the latest Go version is best practice to leverage improvements in generics, module support, and performance.
</Tip>


## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GORM CLI is built with pure Go and supports all major OS platforms where Go runs reliably, including:

- Linux (recommended for production environments and CI setups)
- macOS
- Windows

No special system libraries or platform-specific dependencies are required.

<Tip>
You can run GORM CLI anywhere Go runs, including containers or CI/CD pipelines, as long as the Go runtime matches the minimum version.
</Tip>


## 3. Development Environment Dependencies

- **Go Modules Enabled:** GORM CLI expects module-aware projects. Make sure your Go project uses Go modules (`go.mod`).

- **Database Drivers:** Although GORM CLI generates code for your queries and models, you need the appropriate GORM database driver installed in your project for runtime use (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).


## 4. Network and Access Requirements

- No special network connectivity or ports are required for running GORM CLI.
- The tool operates locally by scanning your Go source code and generating files.

<Note>
Ensure you have read and write permissions for your project directory, especially the output directory where generated code will be saved.
</Note>


## 5. Optional Tools & Recommendations

- **Code Formatter:** GORM CLI attempts to run `goimports` automatically on generated code to format and fix imports.
  - Having `goimports` or `gofmt` available in your PATH improves output quality.

- **Version Control:** Use Git or another VCS to track changes in generated code alongside your source.

- **Editor/IDE:** Tools like GoLand, VSCode with Go extensions, or vim-go help navigate generated APIs efficiently.


## 6. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Go 1.18+ Installed">
Run `go version` and verify the output indicates Go 1.18 or later.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure OS Compatibility">
Use any supported OS (Linux, macOS, Windows) with Go 1.18+ installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Set Up Project with Go Modules">
Have your Go project initialized with `go mod init`.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify File System Permissions">
Make sure you can write to the desired output directories.
</Step>
<Step title="Optional: Install goimports">
Installing `goimports` via `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest` improves formatting of generated files.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">
If your Go version is below 1.18, the generator will not work properly.

**Fix:** Update your Go installation to 1.18 or later.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors When Writing Files">
Ensure your user account has write access to the output directory.

**Fix:** Change permissions or choose an output path where you have rights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing goimports Tool">
The code generator formats output with goimports, which may fail if not installed.

**Fix:** Install with:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Next Steps

After confirming your environment meets these prerequisites:

- Proceed to the [Installing GORM CLI](./installing-gorm-cli) guide to install the CLI tool.
- Review the [Quickstart Workflow](../../overview/integration-getting-started/quickstart-workflow) for a practical introduction to writing interfaces, generating code, and using the generated APIs.
