# Common Issues & Troubleshooting

A practical guide to quickly diagnose and resolve frequent issues encountered when using the GORM CLI code generator. This page focuses on troubleshooting missing dependencies, incompatible Go versions, and problems with model or interface recognition during code generation. Youâ€™ll also find tips for debugging problems and recommended next steps to keep your development on track.

---

## 1. Missing Dependencies

The GORM CLI depends on external tooling and packages to work properly. Common dependency issues arise during installation or runtime with the CLI.

### Symptoms
- `go: command not found` or similar errors when running `go install` or `gorm gen`
- Imports not resolving during code generation
- Compilation errors referencing missing packages like `gorm.io/gorm` or `gorm.io/cli/gorm`

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Go Installation:** Ensure Go is installed and accessible from your command line.

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

   Expected output example:

   ```plaintext
   go version go1.19 linux/amd64
   ```

2. **Check Go Mod Setup:** Your project must use Go Modules. Confirm `go.mod` exists and is correctly configured.

   ```bash
   ls go.mod
   
   # inside go.mod check for required gorm modules
   cat go.mod
   ```

3. **Install the GORM CLI:** Use the official command that pulls the latest stable CLI and its dependencies.

   ```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
   ```

4. **Fetch Missing Dependencies Manually:** Sometimes, dependencies may fail to download automatically.

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go mod download
   ```

5. **Ensure Environment `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` Are Correct:** Especially on Windows or custom setups, misconfigured environment variables can cause failures.

<Tip>
Run `go env` and confirm paths point to valid installations to avoid dependency resolution issues.
</Tip>

### Common Pitfall
- Running the CLI outside of a Go module-enabled directory causes imports and generation to fail silently or with confusing errors.
  Always initialize your project with `go mod init` before code generation.

## 2. Go Version Mismatch

GORM CLI requires Go version 1.18 or later due to Go generics usage.

### Symptoms
- Errors in CLI installation about unsupported syntax or unknown generics
- Compilation errors referencing type parameters

### Verification
Check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If the version is less than Go 1.18, upgrade Go.

### Recommended Actions
- **Upgrade Go** to 1.18+ using your platform's package manager or download from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
- **Verify your shell or IDE picks up the correct Go version** if multiple versions exist.

<Warning>
Using an older Go version leads to compiler failures and unsupported CLI behavior. Upgrading is mandatory.
</Warning>

## 3. Issues with Model or Interface Recognition

GORM CLI generates code from your Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates and model structs.

### Common Problems
- Generator reports "no interfaces found" or "no structs found" despite valid code
- Generated files are empty or missing expected APIs
- Errors parsing SQL template annotations

### Root Causes & Fixes

1. **Incorrect Input Path:** The `-i`/`--input` flag must point to a directory or Go source file containing the interfaces and models.

   ```bash
gorunning: gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

   Ensure this path exists and contains `.go` files with relevant interfaces (e.g., `Query[T any]`) and structs.

2. **Interface or Struct Filtering by genconfig.Config:** If you use a `genconfig.Config` file, it may exclude your interfaces or structs unintentionally.

   - Check `IncludeInterfaces` and `ExcludeInterfaces` patterns.
   - Check `IncludeStructs` and `ExcludeStructs` patterns.
   - Remove or adjust them to include your target interfaces/structs.

3. **Invalid or Missing SQL Annotations on Interfaces:** Each method in your interfaces should have SQL templates in comments to be recognized.

   Example:

   ```go
   // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
   GetByID(id int) (T, error)
   ```

   Missing these or having syntax errors disables code generation for that method.

4. **File Parsing Errors:** Syntax errors or unsupported Go code in your source files can prevent parsing.

   - Run `go build` or `golangci-lint` on your source to catch syntax issues.

<Tip>
Run the generator with verbose logging if available to see detailed parsing errors.

Example command:

```bash
gorunning: gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Check console for error messages.
</Tip>

## 4. Debugging and Next Steps

To streamline troubleshooting:

1. **Validate your environment setup:** ensure Go 1.18+, Go modules enabled, dependencies installed.
2. **Verify your project structure:** all interfaces and models in the input path.
3. **Use sample code from `examples/` directory:** Start from a working example before adding your own.
4. **Check your interface method comments:** They must correctly describe the SQL templates.
5. **Inspect generated files:** Look for warnings and skipped files.
6. **Use `go build` and static analysis:** Fix any Go code issues reported.

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Go version
$ go version

# Validate module and dependencies
$ go mod tidy
$ go mod download

# Run the generator with input and output directories
$ gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Build your generated code
$ go build ./generated
```

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Examples

### Example: Generator Reports "no interfaces found"

```bash
$ gorm gen -i ./models -o ./generated
error processing ./models: no interfaces found in input
```

- Confirm `models` directory contains an interface like `Query[T any]`.
- Check if `genconfig.Config` excludes it.
- Double-check the spelling and location of your source files.

### Example: SQL Template Parsing Error

Sometimes, malformed SQL templates cause generation to fail.

```go
// Incorrect: missing closing braces
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

If your method does not have properly formatted annotations, generator errors will occur.

Fix by ensuring correct SQL comments and template syntax.

## 6. Helpful Tips & Best Practices

- Keep SQL template comments concise and well-formed; use the DSL directives provided.
- Use the `genconfig.Config` selectively, especially `Include*` and `Exclude*` filters.
- Start with small, simple interfaces first to ensure generation works before scaling up.
- Run generation frequently during development.
- If you customize field helpers or mappings, verify they are correctly declared.

## 7. Getting Help

- Refer to the [GORM CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) for issue tracking and example projects.
- Review the official documentation sections on [Template-based Queries](../core-concepts/template-dsl) and [Customizing Generation](../advanced-features-patterns/customizing-generation-config).
- Join GORM community forums or chat to ask questions.
