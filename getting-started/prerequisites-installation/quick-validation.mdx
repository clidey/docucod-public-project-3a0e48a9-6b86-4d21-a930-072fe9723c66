# Validating Your Installation

Ensure your GORM CLI installation is correctly set up and ready to use by running a few simple verification commands. This validation helps confirm that the CLI tool is accessible, responsive, and executing as expected before you proceed with generating code or integrating it into your projects.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Availability

Your first step is to confirm that the `gorm` command-line tool is installed and available in your system's PATH.

### Step 1: Check CLI version

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gorm version
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- The CLI prints the current installed version, such as `gorm version vX.Y.Z`.
- If you see a "command not found" or similar error, the CLI is not installed or not in your PATH.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure you installed the CLI using the recommended method (e.g., `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`).
- Verify that your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory is included in your system's PATH.
- Run `go env GOPATH` to locate your Go workspace.

<Callout title="Tip">
Running `gorm` alone or with `--help` also confirms installation and shows the available commands.
</Callout>

## 2. Confirm Command Execution

Run the built-in help command to confirm that GORM CLI responds appropriately.

```bash
gorm --help
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Lists all available commands, including `gen` for code generation.
- Shows usage syntax and flag options.

If successful, the CLI is ready and operational.

## 3. Test Generator Command (Dry Run)

Since the core task of GORM CLI is to generate code, running a dry test with the `gen` command verifies the CLIâ€™s core functionality.

### Step 1: Run `gen` with no input (expect error)

```bash
gorm gen
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- The CLI will print a message indicating the missing required input flag `-i`, for example:

```plaintext
Error: required flag(s) "input" not set
```

This indicates the CLI recognizes the `gen` command but needs input to run.

### Step 2: Run help for `gen` command

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Outputs usage information specific to code generation, including flags like `-i` (input path) and `-o` (output directory).

## 4. Confirm Go Environment Compatibility

GORM CLI requires Go version 1.18 or higher due to generic support.

### Step 1: Check Go version

```bash
go version
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Output should show Go 1.18 or above, e.g., `go version go1.19.7 darwin/amd64`.

### Troubleshooting
- If version is older than 1.18, upgrade Go before proceeding.

## 5. Optional: Run a Minimal Generator Command

If you have a sample interface file ready, you can attempt a minimal generation step to fully validate the install.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- The CLI processes input and generates code in the specified output directory.
- Displays progress messages about file generation.

### Troubleshooting
- Confirm the input path is correct and points to a valid Go interface file with SQL method annotations.
- Ensure you have write permissions on the output directory.

## Summary of Validation Checks

| Check                  | Command                  | Expected Outcome                                                         |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CLI Version            | `gorm version`           | Prints installed CLI version                                             |
| CLI Availability       | `gorm --help`            | Lists commands including `gen`                                           |
| Generator Command Check| `gorm gen`               | Errors on missing input flag (indicates CLI recognized command)          |
| Generator Help         | `gorm gen --help`        | Shows code generation usage info                                         |
| Go Environment         | `go version`             | Shows Go 1.18+ version                                                    |

## Common Issues and Fixes

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command not found error">
Make sure `gorm` CLI is installed via:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Then add your Go bin folder to your PATH environment variable. For example:

- On Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- On Windows, update the PATH environment variable via system settings.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect Go version">
If `go version` shows a version less than 1.18, download and install the latest Go from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

After upgrade, re-validate your environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Input path errors for `gen` command">
Ensure the input path given to `gorm gen -i` points to a valid Go file containing interfaces with SQL template annotations.

Use absolute paths if relative paths cause issues.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output directory permission errors">
Verify you have write access to the output directory.

If unsure, try an output directory under your user home directory.

</Accordion>

## Next Steps

With your installation validated, proceed to:

- [Preparing Your Models and Interfaces](../first-run-basic-usage/prepare-code) to write your Go interfaces and model structs
- [Running the Generator](../first-run-basic-usage/run-generator) to generate type-safe query APIs
- [Using Generated Code in Your Project](../first-run-basic-usage/using-generated-code) to integrate generated code into your application

Check [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../configuration-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you encounter any difficulties moving forward.

# Appendix: Sample Validation Session

```bash
$ gorm version
gorm version v1.0.0

$ gorm --help
Usage: gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

$ gorm gen
Error: required flag(s) "input" not set

$ gorm gen --help
Usage:
  gorm gen -i <input_interface.go> [-o <output_dir>]

Flags:
  -i, --input string    Path to Go interface file with raw SQL annotations (required)
  -o, --output string   Directory to place generated code (default "./g")

$ go version
go version go1.19.2 linux/amd64
```

Successful confirmation looks similar to these outputs.
