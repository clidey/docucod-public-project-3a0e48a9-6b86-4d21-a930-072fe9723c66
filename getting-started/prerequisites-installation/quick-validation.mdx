# Quick Validation

Welcome to the final preparation step before you start leveraging the powerful features of GORM CLI. This guide helps you **quickly verify** that GORM CLI is correctly installed and accessible from your command line environment. Ensuring your CLI tool is recognized and ready prevents blockers before you move forward to writing queries and generating code.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Installation

Before running any generation commands, confirm that GORM CLI is available and functioning correctly on your system.

### Step 1: Check CLI availability

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected outcome:

- You see the GORM CLI usage instructions.
- The main `gorm` command displays available subcommands, including `gen`.

If you get an error like `command not found` or `not recognized`, it means the CLI is not installed correctly or not in your system PATH.

### Troubleshooting:

- Ensure you installed the CLI using Go's install command:
  ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
- Verify that your Go `bin` directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `~/go/bin`) is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

<Tip>
If you’re on Windows and installed Go, remember to add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` to your PATH.
On Linux/macOS, add `$HOME/go/bin` to your PATH.
</Tip>

## 2. Check the `gen` Subcommand

Once the CLI is recognized, confirm that the `gen` subcommand is available and responsive.

Run:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

Expected output:

- Description of the `gen` command.
- Flags such as `-i, --input` and `-o, --output` with explanations.

This confirms the core generation command is accessible.

## 3. Perform a Dry-Run Basic Generation

Test the CLI with a minimal command to validate it triggers properly without errors.

### Pre-requisites:
- An example Go interface file that contains query method definitions with SQL template comments.

If you don’t have one ready, you can use the provided example path `./examples/query.go` if you cloned the repository.

### Command:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

Expected result:

- The CLI outputs messages about generating files.
- A new directory `generated` is created (if it didn’t exist).
- Generated files are created inside `generated` corresponding to your input.

### What happens under the hood?
- GORM CLI parses the input Go interface file.
- It extracts annotated SQL templates.
- It generates type-safe query APIs in the output folder.

<Tip>
Use relative or absolute paths for input and output. If omitted, output defaults to `./g`.
The `-i` flag is required.
</Tip>

### Troubleshooting:

- If you see errors about `input path required`, ensure you provide the `-i` flag.
- Syntax or parsing errors indicate issues in your source file annotations; check your query interface comments.

## 4. Confirm CLI Version (Optional)

You can check the version of the installed CLI version (if available) for consistency.

```bash
gorm version
```

If this command is not recognized, skip this step.

## Summary

By following these simple test steps, you will have confirmed:

- GORM CLI is installed and executable.
- The key `gen` command is available.
- The CLI can process your input file and generate code output.

This quick validation ensures your environment is correctly set up, so you can proceed to **defining your models and query interfaces**, and then **run your first code generation**.
