# Installing GORM CLI

Step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool using Go tooling. This guide covers installation on Unix-like systems, Windows, and via Go modules, enabling you to quickly get the CLI running on your development machine or servers.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version**: 1.18 or higher (generics support is essential)
- **Supported platforms**: Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows
- **Network access**: Your machine must be able to fetch Go packages from `gorm.io` and its dependencies

If you have not installed Go or need to verify your Go installation, run:

```bash
go version
```

Expect output similar to:

```
go version go1.19 linux/amd64
```

If Go is not installed, please install it from the official site: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

<Tip>
Using Go 1.18 or newer is mandatory since the GORM CLI leverages Go generics.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Methods

GORM CLI can be installed using native Go tooling in multiple ways depending on your OS and preferences.

### 2.1 Install via `go install` (Recommended)

This is the fastest method and works on any platform that supports Go:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command downloads the latest version of GORM CLI and installs the binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory.
- Make sure your binary directory is in your system `PATH` to run `gorm` directly.

<Check>
Verify installation by running:

```bash
gorm --version
```

You should see the CLI version output.
</Check>

### 2.2 Manual Clone & Build

If you prefer to build from source or want to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GORM CLI repository:

    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.git
cd cli
```

2. Build the `gorm` CLI binary:

    ```bash
go build -o gorm ./cmd/gorm
```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH.

### 2.3 Windows Installation

On Windows, you can run the same `go install` command in a Command Prompt or PowerShell with Go installed:

```powershell
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- Ensure your `%GOPATH%\bin` is added to the Windows system PATH.
- After installation, open a new terminal and run `gorm --version` to confirm.

---

## 3. Post-Installation Verification

After installing, confirm the CLI is correctly set up:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see a list of commands including `gen`, which is the code generation command:

```
Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```

If `gorm --help` works, your installation is successful.

<Warning>
If `gorm` command is not found:
- Verify Go's bin directory is in your PATH
- On Unix-like systems, run `echo $PATH` and check for `$HOME/go/bin` or wherever Go is installed
- On Windows, check PATH environment variables
</Warning>

---

## 4. Quick Start Example

To further confirm your CLI is functioning, run a simple code generation using the provided example interfaces:

1. Create a folder named `examples` in your workspace.
2. Add a sample interface file `examples/query.go` with query definitions.
3. Run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` flag points to the input directory or file containing raw SQL annotated Go interfaces.
- `-o` specifies the output directory where generated code will be placed.

Success will print generated file information:

```
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
```

## 5. Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Command Not Found After Installation

- Confirm `$GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin` is in your environment PATH.
- Restart your terminal or system after modifying PATH.

### 5.2 Go Version Errors

- Ensure Go 1.18+ is installed.
- Run `go version` to verify.

### 5.3 Network or Module Fetch Issues

- Check your internet connection and proxy settings.
- Use `GOPROXY` environment variable to control module proxy.

### 5.4 Permission Issues

- For Unix-like OS, ensure you have write permission to Go mod cache and bin directories.
- Use `sudo` cautiously; prefer user-local installations.

<Tip>
Use verbose flags in Go commands for more detailed error messages:

```
go install -v gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
</Tip>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that GORM CLI is installed:

- Proceed to [Initial Project Setup](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/initial-project-setup) to configure your Go project and models.
- Learn how to [Configure Code Generation](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/configuring-generation).
- Follow the guide on [Running the Generator](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/running-the-generator) to produce your first type-safe query APIs.
