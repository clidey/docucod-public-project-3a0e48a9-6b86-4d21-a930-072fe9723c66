# Installing GORM CLI

Step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI on all supported platforms using Go tooling. Following this guide ensures the CLI tool is correctly added to your environment and ready to use.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, verify you meet the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or newer is required, as GORM CLI uses Go generics.
- **Go Environment Setup**: Ensure your Go environment (`GOROOT`, `GOPATH`) is properly configured.
- **Path Configuration**: Your system's PATH must include the directory where Go installs binaries (`$GOPATH/bin` or default Go bin folder) so you can run the CLI from anywhere.

<Tip>
To check your Go version, run:

```bash
go version
```

If Go is not installed or the version is below 1.18, download and install the latest Go from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

The recommended installation method uses the `go install` command.

### Install GORM CLI with Go

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the install command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command downloads and installs the latest GORM CLI binary into your Go bin directory.

3. Confirm the installation path for the binary is in your system PATH.

- For Unix/macOS, typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`
- For Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`

4. Verify installation:

```bash
gorm --version
```

You should see the CLI version printed without error.

<Tip>
If you see "command not found" or similar, ensure your Go bin directory is added to your PATH environment variable.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Verifying Your Installation

Confirm that GORM CLI installed successfully and is ready to use with these checks:

### Check CLI Help Command

Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected outcome:

- Display of the CLI usage, available commands, and their short descriptions.
- The root command `gorm` and subcommand `gen` should appear.

### Validate `gen` Subcommand

Run:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

Expected outcome:

- Details on the `gen` command flags such as `--input` and `--output`.
- Instructions on how to generate code from Go interface files.

<Tip>
If the help commands display without errors, your installation is successfully configured.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version is Too Low or Missing">
- Ensure Go 1.18 or later is installed.
- Update your Go installation from https://golang.org/dl/
- Reopen your terminal after install.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
- Verify `$GOPATH/bin` or equivalent is added to your PATH.
- On Unix/macOS, add `export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"` to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc).
- On Windows, add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` to your system PATH environment variable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Installation Fails with Permission Error">
- Run the install command with appropriate permissions.
- On Unix-like systems, avoid using sudo; fix permissions to your Go workspace instead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Multiple Go Versions Cause Conflicts">
- Ensure your terminal uses the correct Go version (check `which go` / `where go`).
- Remove or update old Go versions that could shadow the newer one.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If problems persist, consult the Go installation documentation and your system environment settings before retrying.
</Tip>

## 5. Next Steps After Installation

Now that GORM CLI is installed, you can:

- Define your query interfaces and Go model structs.
- Use the `gorm gen` command to generate type-safe query APIs and helpers.
- Integrate generated code with your GORM-based projects for safer and easier database interactions.

- [Generating Code](/getting-started/first-codegen-project/generate-code)
- [Using the Generated APIs](/getting-started/first-codegen-project/quickstart-usage)

<Check>
You have successfully installed GORM CLI and verified it is accessible.
You're ready to proceed with code generation and integration.
</Check>

## 6. Summary

Installing GORM CLI involves a simple Go install command requiring Go 1.18+ with proper PATH setup. Verifying the installation with help commands ensures readiness. Common issues revolve around Go version conflicts and PATH misconfiguration and can be resolved with environment corrections.

Use the CLI to generate code and accelerate your Go GORM development with safe and fluent database APIs.

## Appendix: Installation Example Session

```bash
$ go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

$ gorm --version
GORM CLI Tool vX.Y.Z

$ gorm --help
Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

$ gorm gen --help
Usage:
  gorm gen --input <file> [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for gen
  -i, --input string  Path to Go interface file with raw SQL annotations (required)
  -o, --output string Directory to place generated code (default "./g")
```

This confirms a correct, usable installation.
