# Validating Your Installation

Ensure your GORM CLI installation is correctly set up and available on your system by running a few simple verification commands. This page guides you through confirming the CLI is working as intended and offers troubleshooting tips if you encounter issues.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Is Installed

After installing the GORM CLI tool using the command below:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Verify that the executable is accessible from your command line:

```bash
gorm --version
```

### Expected outcome:
- The command outputs the GORM CLI version number.
- No error messages like "command not found".

If you see version information, the CLI is installed and available in your system `PATH`.

---

## 2. Check that `gorm gen` Command Works

The `gen` subcommand triggers code generation and is fundamental for your workflow. Test that this command runs and shows help information:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

### Expected outcome:
- Detailed help text with usage, flags, and description for `gorm gen`.

This confirms the CLI recognizes the subcommand and can parse flags.

---

## 3. Run a Basic Generation Help Example

To further verify, run the generator command without arguments:

```bash
gorm gen
```

### Expected outcome:
- Error message indicating required flags (like `-i` input path).
- No unexpected runtime errors.

This indicates the CLI runs its internal logic and validates parameters.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Validation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found or CLI Not Recognized">
- Ensure your Go binary path (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is added to your system `PATH`.
- Restart your terminal or shell session after installation.
- Confirm installation succeeded by checking for the binary in `$GOPATH/bin/gorm`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version Command Shows Error or No Output">
- Verify you installed with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` targeting Go 1.18 or higher.
- Run `go version` to confirm your Go installation.
- Reinstall the CLI after ensuring environment readiness.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm gen` Command Errors Unexpectedly">
- Check that you are inside a valid Go module or directory with Go source files.
- Provide required flags, especially `-i` for the input directory or file.
- Examine error messages closely for missing files or permissions issues.
- Consult the [CLI Installation Guide](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/cli-installation) for setup details.

## 5. Validate Installation in Your Project

Use the CLI in your project directory to ensure it can process your Go interface files:

```bash
# In your project folder
gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./generated
```

Successful code generation prints generated files and indicates no errors.
