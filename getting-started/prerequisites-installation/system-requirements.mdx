# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets these minimum system and software requirements to use GORM CLI effectively. This guarantees compatibility with Go generics, smooth integration with GORM, and a reliable code generation experience.

---

## 1. Operating System

GORM CLI supports the following platforms:

- **Linux** (most distributions)
- **macOS** (10.13+ recommended)
- **Windows** (Windows 10 and later)

> GORM CLI is distributed as a Go binary and requires a working Go environment on your platform.

## 2. Go Version

- **Go 1.18 or newer** is required.

GORM CLI relies heavily on **Go generics**, a feature introduced in Go 1.18. Attempting to run or build it with versions earlier than 1.18 will result in errors.

### Installing Go

If Go is not installed or your version is outdated, follow these steps:

- Download the latest Go version from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Follow platform-specific installation instructions.
- Verify installation with:

```bash
go version
```

The output should indicate Go 1.18 or higher.

## 3. Disk Space and Memory

- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free space is recommended to accommodate the GORM CLI binaries, generated code, and dependencies.
- **Memory:** Minimum 1 GB RAM is sufficient for typical projects; larger projects may require more during code generation.

## 4. Network Requirements

- Internet connectivity is required to download the GORM CLI and Go dependencies if you are fetching them via `go install` or `go get`.
- No special firewall or proxy settings are required for local generation once packages are installed.

## 5. GORM Integration

- **GORM Package:** GORM CLI generates code compatible with the [`gorm.io/gorm`](https://gorm.io/) package.
- Ensure you have GORM v1.23 or above in your project as this aligns with generics and API expectations from generated code.

### Checking your GORM version

Run in your project directory:

```bash
go list -m all | grep gorm.io/gorm
```

If your GORM version is older, upgrade it:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm@latest
```

## 6. Additional Dependencies

- No other external runtime dependencies are required.
- The GORM CLI reads Go source code files and generates code locally.

---

## Quick Verification Checklist

Run these commands to confirm your environment meets requirements:

```bash
go version
# Should be 1.18 or above

gorm --version
# Verify GORM CLI installation if installed
```

If `gorm` is not found, see the installation instructions on the [Installing GORM CLI](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-gorm-cli) page.

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Old">

Your Go version is less than 1.18.

**Solution:** Update Go to at least version 1.18 following the official installation guides.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM CLI Command Not Found">

After installing GORM CLI with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`, the binary may not be in your PATH.

**Solution:** Add your Go bin directory (typically `$HOME/go/bin` on Linux/macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` on Windows) to your system PATH.

Verify by running:

```bash
gorm --version
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Disk Space or Memory">

Generation may fail or be slow if disk space or available memory is too low.

**Solution:** Free up space and close unnecessary applications. Re-run generation commands.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM Version Incompatible">

If generated code does not compile, ensure your project uses GORM version 1.23+.

Use `go get -u gorm.io/gorm@latest` to upgrade.

## Next Steps

Once system requirements are satisfied:

1. Proceed to the [Installing GORM CLI](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-gorm-cli) documentation to install and set up the CLI tool.
2. Follow the [Initial Project Setup](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/initial-project-setup) guide to prepare your project for generation.
3. Explore the [Configuring Code Generation](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/configuring-generation) page for customization options.

Ensure you have a supported OS, the correct Go version, and GORM integration before starting the generator.
