# System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets these system prerequisites before installing and using GORM CLI. Proper setup guarantees seamless type-safe code generation and integration with your Go projects.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is a Go-based command-line tool designed to run where your Go toolchain is supported. The officially supported operating systems are:

- **Linux** (x86_64, ARM64)
- **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** (64-bit)

Since GORM CLI is distributed as a Go package and compiled from source, any OS supported by Go 1.18+ can run the tool reliably.


<Check>
Verify your OS is one of the supported platforms before proceeding with installation.
</Check>

---

## 2. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in Go 1.18. To use all features, especially the type-safe code generation, ensure:

- **Go version 1.18 or higher** is installed and active in your $PATH

You can verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output should begin with `go version go1.18` or later, for example:

```
go version go1.20.3 darwin/amd64
```

Using an older Go version will cause build and runtime errors due to missing generics support.

<Tip>
Always keep your Go version up-to-date to benefit from language improvements affecting GORM CLI and your projects.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Dependencies and Tooling

### 3.1 Go Toolchain

- **Ensure Go is installed and configured:**

  - Install from https://golang.org/dl/
  - Set environment variables like `GOPATH` or use Go modules (`GO111MODULE=on`) as per your project setup

### 3.2 Database Drivers

Though GORM CLI focuses on code generation rather than runtime DB connectivity, your projects using generated code will require corresponding GORM drivers for your databases, e.g.,:

- MySQL: `gorm.io/driver/mysql`
- PostgreSQL: `gorm.io/driver/postgres`
- SQLite: `gorm.io/driver/sqlite`


### 3.3 External Tools

- None are required specifically for GORM CLI beyond Go itself.

---

## 4. Network and Permissions

- No special network requirements for running the CLI locally.
- Ensure your local user account has permission to write files to your workspace directories where code will be generated.

<Warning>
Lack of write permissions to output directories will cause generation failures.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Environment Setup Summary

Follow this checklist to prepare your environment:

- [ ] Operating system supported and updated
- [ ] Go 1.18+ installed and verified
- [ ] Go environment variables correctly set
- [ ] Proper permissions to create files in output folders


---

## 6. Verify Your Environment

Run the following commands to confirm your environment supports GORM CLI:

```bash
# Confirm OS info (example for Linux/macos)
uname -a

# Confirm Go version
  go version

# Try to install GORM CLI (downloads and compiles)
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

After installation, you can check the CLI version:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output should include the CLI usage description, confirming a successful environment setup.

## 7. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Not Found or Wrong Version">

- **Symptom:** `go: command not found` or Go version < 1.18
- **Fix:** Install or update Go from https://golang.org/dl/ and set PATH environment variable appropriately.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied When Generating Files">

- **Symptom:** Errors writing generated files to output directory
- **Fix:** Check file system permissions; run the CLI with sufficient permissions or choose an output directory with write access.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported OS or Architecture">

- **Symptom:** Binary fails to run or compile on your OS
- **Fix:** Use an officially supported OS version; for cross-compilation, ensure Go environment variables are correctly set.
