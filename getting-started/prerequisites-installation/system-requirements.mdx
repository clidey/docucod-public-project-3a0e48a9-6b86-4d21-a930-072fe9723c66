# System Requirements for GORM CLI

Ensure your development environment meets the following prerequisites before installing and using GORM CLI. This will help you avoid compatibility issues and guarantee a smooth setup experience.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

- GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later**.
- This version is necessary because GORM CLI leverages Go generics, a feature introduced in Go 1.18.

> Using earlier versions of Go will cause installation or runtime failures.

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

GORM CLI works on systems that support Go 1.18 and above, which includes:

- Linux (x86_64, ARM64, others supported by Go)
- macOS
- Windows

> The CLI is a Go binary, so as long as you have Go installed properly on your platform, GORM CLI will work.

## 3. Environment Setup Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure the following environment settings are in place:

### Go Environment

- `GOPATH` should be set correctly if you are not using Go modules.
- For modern Go projects, ensure your module-enabled project (with a `go.mod` file) is initialized.

### Path Configuration

- Your Go binary directory should be in your system `PATH` so you can run installed Go tools easily.

On Unix-like systems, this could look like:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

On Windows, update the PATH environment variable accordingly.

### Network Access

- Access to the public Go module proxy or directly to module repositories.
- This is required to download `gorm.io/cli/gorm` and any dependencies.

## 4. Disk Space and Memory

- Minimal disk space is needed (under 100MB typically) for installation.
- Ensure you have at least 512MB of free memory for running Go commands and GORM CLI.

## 5. Optional Dependencies

While GORM CLI primarily requires Go, your project might require:

- A configured database accessible via GORM for integration (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- This is relevant when running or testing generated code but not needed strictly for installation.

## Installation Preparation Checklist

<Check>
- Go 1.18+ installed (`go version`)
- Go environment properly configured (`go env`)
- GOPATH/bin added to PATH
- Network connectivity for downloading modules
</Check>

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Environment Setup">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Not Found">

**Symptom:** Running `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` yields an error "cannot use generics features" or "command not found".

**Resolution:**
- Confirm Go version: `go version`.
- Upgrade Go from [official site](https://go.dev/dl/) if below 1.18.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="PATH Does Not Include Go Bin Directory">

**Symptom:** After installing GORM CLI, running `gorm` or `gorm gen` gives 'command not found'.

**Resolution:**
- Add your Go bin directory to your system PATH.
- Example on macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```
- Restart terminal or source environment.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues When Installing">

**Symptom:** Installation fails due to network timeout or download errors.

**Resolution:**
- Check your internet connection.
- Configure GOPROXY environment variable, e.g., `export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct`
- Retry installation.
