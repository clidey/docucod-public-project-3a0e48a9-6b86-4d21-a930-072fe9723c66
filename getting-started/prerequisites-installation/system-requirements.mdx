# System Requirements for GORM CLI

Ensure your environment meets the following hardware and software prerequisites to install and run GORM CLI smoothly. This page helps you understand what base setup is required before proceeding to installation.

---

## 1. Operating System Support

GORM CLI is compatible with all major platforms where Go is supported. Confirm your operating system matches one of the following:

- **Linux** (any modern distribution)
- **macOS** (macOS 10.12 or later)
- **Windows** (Windows 10 or later)


## 2. Hardware Requirements

GORM CLI is lightweight and does not require significant hardware capacity. However, for optimal performance:

- **CPU:** Modern multi-core processor (x86_64 or ARM is supported)
- **Memory:** Minimum 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended for large projects)
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free for tool installation and generated files

> These requirements ensure comfortable workspace performance when generating code for medium-sized projects.


## 3. Software Dependencies

Before installing GORM CLI, confirm the following software dependencies are in place:

### Go Language

- **Go version 1.18 or higher** is mandatory as GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in 1.18.
- Ensure `go` command is available in your system path.

```bash
go version
```
Expected output example:

```plaintext
go version go1.20.2 linux/amd64
```

<Check>
If your Go version is below 1.18, upgrade Go before proceeding to install GORM CLI.
</Check>

### Environment Variables

- GOPATH and GOBIN should be properly configured to enable smooth `go install` and binary execution.

- The system PATH must include the directory where `go install` places binaries (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin` or default Go bin location).


## 4. Network Requirements

- Internet access is required to download the GORM CLI tool via `go install`.
- No open ports or inbound firewall rules are generally needed as GORM CLI runs locally.


## 5. Additional Considerations

- **IDE/Editor Support:** While optional, use Go-aware IDEs (like GoLand, VS Code) for a better developer experience.
- **Database Connectivity:** Although GORM CLI generates code for your data models and queries, ensure that your development environment has access to the appropriate database drivers and instances as required by your application.


---

## Quick Environment Check

Run the following commands in your terminal to validate your environment:

```bash
# Check OS
uname -a  # Linux/macOS
ver       # Windows Command Prompt

# Check Go version
go version

# Verify Go binary installed
which gorm || where gorm
```

If all commands report expected results, your environment is ready for GORM CLI installation.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and How to Fix Them">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Not Installed">

- **Problem:** Running `go version` shows an unsupported version or command not found.
- **Solution:** Download and install Go 1.18 or later from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="'go' Command Not Found or PATH Issues">

- **Problem:** Executing `go` command in terminal fails.
- **Solution:** Add Go binary folder to your system PATH environment variable.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions to Install Binaries">

- **Problem:** Errors when running `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- **Solution:** Ensure you have write permissions to your Go bin directory. Use `sudo` carefully on Unix systems if necessary.
