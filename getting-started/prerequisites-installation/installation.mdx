# Installing GORM CLI

This guide provides **clear, step-by-step instructions** to install GORM CLI on your system using the Go toolchain. By following these steps, you will have the CLI ready to generate type-safe query APIs and model-based field helpers for your GORM projects within minutes.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version**: You must have Go 1.18 or higher installed. GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in this version.
- **Supported platforms**: Installation instructions support all platforms where Go is supported (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Network access**: To install the CLI, your machine must be able to download packages from the public Go module proxy (internet access required).

<Tip>
If you have not installed Go 1.18+, download it from the official site: https://go.dev/dl/
Check your Go version by running:
```bash
go version
```
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install GORM CLI using the Go toolchain:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your terminal">
Launch your terminal or command prompt.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Go install command">
Execute the following command to install the latest version of GORM CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This downloads, builds, and installs the binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the binary path is in your system PATH">
Ensure your Go binary install directory is added to your system's `PATH` environment variable so you can run the `gorm` command directly:

- On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
  
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

- On Windows, add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your user or system PATH environment variable.

Restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm installation succeeded">
Run:

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see version information without errors.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you encounter a "command not found" error, double-check that your Go binary path is correctly added to your `PATH`.
</Tip>

## 3. Common Setup Scenarios

### Installing on Systems without Go Installed

If you don't have Go installed yet, please install Go 1.18+ first before proceeding with the CLI installation.

### Installing Behind a Proxy or Firewall

If your network restricts internet access, configure Go module proxy environment variables appropriately, such as `GOPROXY`, or use a private mirror.

### Upgrading GORM CLI

To upgrade to the latest version later, simply run the install command again:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

---

## 4. Verifying the Installation

Once installed, quickly verify that GORM CLI is ready:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected outcome:

- Displays the installed GORM CLI version.
- No error messages.

If you see errors, check your Go environment setup and PATH as described above.

<Tip>
For a basic validation of GORM CLI functionality, try running the built-in help command:
```bash
gorm --help
```
You should see usage instructions for the CLI.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Running Your First Code Generation

After installation, you are ready to generate code from your models and query interfaces.

### Quick Example

Assuming you have your Go files with models and interfaces in `./examples`:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` specifies the input path containing your interfaces and models.
- `-o` specifies the output directory for generated code (defaults to `./g` if omitted).

Successful generation will create type-safe query APIs and field helpers under the specified output path.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation">
<Accordion title="Go Not Installed or Version Too Low">
Verify Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Ensure it is 1.18 or higher.

Install/upgrade Go from https://go.dev/dl/
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="`gorm` command not found">
Make sure your Go bin directory is in your PATH:

- Check GOPATH bin path:

  ```bash
  echo $(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

- Add it to PATH if missing.

Restart your terminal after changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Access Errors during Installation">
If `go install` fails due to network issues:

- Configure GOPROXY environment variable:

  ```bash
  export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  ```

- Check firewall or proxy settings that might block Go module downloads.

## 7. Next Steps

- **Prepare your models and interfaces** for code generation (see [Preparing Your Models and Interfaces](../first-run-basic-usage/prepare-code)).
- **Run the code generator** to create your APIs ([Running the Generator](../first-run-basic-usage/run-generator)).
- **Use the generated code** in your Go projects ([Using Generated Code](../first-run-basic-usage/using-generated-code)).
