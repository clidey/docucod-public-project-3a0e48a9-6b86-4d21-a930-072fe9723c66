# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your development environment effectively to ensure a seamless experience with GORM CLI. This guide covers all the necessary prerequisites, environment settings, and platform compatibility so you can avoid common setup pitfalls before installation.

---

## 1. System Requirements

GORM CLI is built for developers working with Go and GORM projects. To run the CLI tool properly, your system must meet the following minimum specifications:

- **Operating Systems Supported:** Linux, macOS, Windows (64-bit architectures recommended)
- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or later (due to heavy reliance on Go generics)
- **Memory:** Minimum 512 MB RAM available (more recommended for larger projects)
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free space for installation and generated code

> GORM CLI requires native Go 1.18+ support because it generates type-safe Go code utilizing generics.


## 2. Dependencies

Before using GORM CLI, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Go (golang):** Install Go from the official site https://golang.org/dl/. Confirm installation by running:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output example:

```bash
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

- **GORM:** While GORM CLI generates code targeting the GORM library, GORM itself should be added as a dependency in your Go project via:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
```

- **Git:** Required to fetch the CLI tool and dependencies smoothly.

- **Network Access:** Make sure your system can access github.com and golang.org for downloads.


## 3. Access & Permissions

- **User Permissions:** You need permission to install Go packages globally or within your Go workspace.
- **File System Access:** Your IDE or terminal must have write permission in the directory where you intend to generate code.


## 4. Environment Variables

Configure your environment variables to streamline GORM CLI usage:

- **`GOPATH` and `GOROOT`**: Ensure Go environment variables are properly set.
  - Check current values:

  ```bash
  go env GOPATH
  go env GOROOT
  ```

- **`PATH` Updated:** Confirm your `GOPATH/bin` (or module bin path) is in your system `PATH` for CLI accessibility:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- **Database DSNs and Credentials:** Although not directly related to GORM CLI installation, ensure your Go project environment includes any database connection strings or credentials securely when running generated code.


## 5. Platform and Version Compatibility

The GORM CLI tool compiles and runs on all major platforms supporting Go 1.18+:

| Platform     | Supported Go Versions | Notes                       |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Linux        | 1.18+                | Tested on Ubuntu, Fedora     |
| macOS        | 1.18+                | Supports Intel and ARM Macs  |
| Windows      | 1.18+                | 64-bit only                  |


## 6. Common Environment Setup Pitfalls

Avoid these common issues:

- **Using Older Go Versions:** GORM CLI uses Go generics introduced in 1.18; earlier versions will cause installation or runtime errors.
- **Incorrect `PATH` Setup:** If your Go binary path is missing from `PATH`, executing the CLI (`gorm`) will fail.
- **Permissions Issues:** Generating code in restricted directories will result in write errors.
- **Incompatible OS Architecture:** Using a 32-bit system may prevent tool installation or cause unexpected failures.


## 7. Verifying Your Setup

After installing Go, verify prerequisites with the commands below:

```bash
# Verify Go version
go version

# Verify $GOPATH/bin is in PATH
echo $PATH

# Confirm Go mod is enabled
go env GO111MODULE
```

Successfully printing Go version 1.18+ and correct paths indicates a ready environment.


## 8. Tips for Optimal Setup

- Use the latest Go patch version within the 1.18+ series for maximum bug fixes and security.
- Configure your editor or IDE (VS Code, GoLand) to recognize Go modules and GOPATH correctly.
- Create a dedicated workspace or project directory for your GORM CLI usage to keep generated files organized.
