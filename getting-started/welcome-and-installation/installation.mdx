# Installation Guide

This guide provides clear, platform-agnostic instructions to install the GORM CLI tool using `go install`. Follow these steps to reliably obtain the latest version of GORM CLI and resolve common installation issues.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version:** 1.18 or higher (required due to generics usage)
- **Supported platforms:** All platforms supported by your Go installation
- **Network access:** Internet connectivity to fetch the `gorm.io/cli/gorm/gorm` package
- **Environment configuration:** GOPATH and Go environment correctly set, so `go install` can place binaries appropriately

<Tip>
If unsure about your Go version, run `go version` in your terminal.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

The simplest and recommended method to install the latest GORM CLI is via the `go install` command. This fetches the latest release and compiles the binary.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the latest version:

```bash
# Install the latest GORM CLI version
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

3. Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory is included in your system PATH environment variable.

4. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
gorm version
```

or

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see GORM CLIâ€™s version information or help output confirming successful installation.

<Check>
If the `gorm` command is not found after installation, make sure your Go binary path is added to your system's `PATH`.
</Check>

---

## 3. Alternative Installation Notes

If you want to install a specific version or tag, replace `@latest` with the version.

```bash
# Example: Install v1.2.3 version
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v1.2.3
```

For managing versions or installations inside CI pipelines, lock the version explicitly to avoid unexpected changes.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

Here are some common problems and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="'command not found' after installation">
Ensure your Go binaries directory is in your system PATH. This is typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

Example for Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

On Windows, add the Go bin path to the PATH environment variable through System Settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
Upgrade your Go version to 1.18 or higher since GORM CLI uses generics. Download and install Go from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/

Verify upgrade by running `go version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network connectivity errors when running `go install`">
Verify your internet connection and proxy settings. If you are behind a proxy, configure Go modules proxy environment variables:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

Alternatively, try `go clean -modcache` to reset module cache if corrupted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission errors writing to GOPATH or system binaries">
Make sure you have appropriate write permissions to the designated `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

On Unix systems, avoid running `go install` with `sudo` to prevent permission conflicts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Verifying the Installed Version

After installation, confirm that GORM CLI is installed correctly and gather version information:

```bash
gorm version
```

If the command succeeds and prints version info or help text, your installation is complete and working.

## 6. Next Steps

After a successful installation, proceed with:

- [Basic Configuration Setup](./basic-configuration) to prepare your project for code generation.
- [Generating Your First Code](./generating-code) to run your first generation from query interfaces and models.
- [Using the Generated APIs](./using-generated-apis) to start integrating generated code in your Go applications.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](./troubleshooting) page if you encounter issues beyond installation.
