# Troubleshooting Installation & Validation

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve common issues during the installation of GORM CLI and validation of your initial code generation. If your installation fails, dependencies are missing, or your generated code does not behave as expected, follow these steps to identify and fix the root causes.

---

## 1. Common Installation Issues and Fixes

### Prerequisite Checks
Ensure your system meets these requirements before installing GORM CLI:

- **Go Version**: You must be running Go 1.18 or later since GORM CLI depends on generics.
- **Network Access**: Verify your machine can access the `gorm.io/cli/gorm` module repository.

<Tip>
Run `go version` to confirm your Go runtime and `go env GOPROXY` to verify module proxy settings.
</Tip>

### Installation Verification
Install GORM CLI using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

After installation, verify that the CLI is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see usage information without errors. If the command is not found:
- Check your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `$PATH`.
- Re-run installation and watch for errors.

### Fixing Missing Dependencies or Module Issues

If installing GORM CLI results in missing dependencies or version conflicts:

- Ensure you have an active internet connection (for `go get` to fetch modules).
- Clear your Go module cache using:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

- Retry installation.

- Check your `go.mod` file in your project for Go version and module proxy configurations.

## 2. Validating Your First Code Generation

After installation, you run your first code generation with the `gorm gen` command.

### 2.1. Validate Input Path and Interface
Ensure you specify the correct input source directory or file containing your Go interfaces with SQL templates:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Common issues:

- **Input path is missing or incorrect**: The CLI requires `-i` flag; ensure it points to your folder or file.
- **No interfaces found**: Check your Go files in the given input contain interfaces with proper SQL annotations.

### 2.2. Check Output Directory
By default, the output directory is `./g`. If you set a custom output directory, confirm you have write permissions there.

### 2.3. Confirm Generated Files
After generation runs, verify that new `.go` files appear under the output path.

- Typical output will include type-safe query API implementations and field helpers matching your interfaces and models.
- The CLI will print logs like `Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...`

### 2.4. Build the Generated Code
Run a Go build or test on your project including the generated code:

```bash
go build ./...
```

This confirms the generated code is syntactically correct and compiles with your project.

If build errors occur:
- Review your models and query interfaces for typing mistakes.
- Ensure any required configuration (e.g., `genconfig.Config`) is present if you have custom field mappings.

---

## 3. Diagnosing Unexpected or Missing Output

### 3.1. No Generated Interfaces or Structs
The generator applies inclusion/exclusion filters during code gen based on your configuration. Check for:

- `genconfig.Config` files that specify `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, or `ExcludeStructs`. These filters influence which code gets generated.
- Incorrect or overly restrictive filters can prevent interfaces or structs from being processed.

### 3.2. Generated Code Missing Expected Methods
- Ensure your interface method comments include valid SQL templates.
- The CLI requires SQL template comments in interface methods to generate code properly.

### 3.3. File-Level vs Package-Level Configuration
If your config uses `FileLevel: true`, it only applies to the exact file, not the entire package. This can cause partial generation if you expect package-wide effects.

## 4. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Go Environment">
Run `go version` and `go env GOPATH` to confirm your Go environment.
Ensure GOPATH/bin is in your PATH.
</Step>
<Step title="Install GORM CLI">
Execute `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` and check for errors.
Use `gorm --help` to confirm CLI installed successfully.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Generation Command">
Use `gorm gen -i <input_path> -o <output_path>` and observe output logs.
Check that your input directory contains interfaces with proper SQL comments.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Generated Code">
Look in the output directory for `.go` files.
Open them to see generated type-safe API code.
</Step>
<Step title="Build Your Project">
Run `go build ./...` to check that your project including generated code compiles.
Fix any errors by reviewing interfaces, models, and configs.
</Step>
<Step title="Consult Logs and Fix Errors">
If errors arise:
- Check syntax in input interfaces.
- Verify configs for Include/Exclude filters.
- Confirm correct package imports.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Errors

<AccordionGroup title="Common Errors and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Error: 'flag needs an argument: -i'">
This error occurs if the input path argument is missing after `-i`.

**Fix**: Provide a valid file or directory path after the `-i` flag.

Example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error: 'can't parse file X.go: ...'">
Indicates a syntax error in one of your input Go files.

**Fix**: Use `go fmt` and `go vet` on your source.
Correct any invalid Go syntax.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No generated files appear after running gorm gen">
Possible causes:
- Your input files have no recognized interfaces or models.
- Inclusion/exclusion filters in genconfig.Config exclude all target interfaces.

**Fixes**:
- Verify interfaces contain SQL comments.
- Check your generation config filtering rules.
- Remove or adjust filters to include targets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build errors referencing generated code types">
Often caused by mismatched versions or incomplete generation.

**Fix**:
- Regenerate code after cleaning output directory.
- Check that your Go modules are up to date.
- Confirm you have required imports in your project.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Validating Your Output with a Sample Run

After successful generation and build:

1. Import your generated package (e.g., `generated`).
2. Use generated query APIs in your application:

```go
// Assuming User model and generated package
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to fetch user: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println("User:", u)
```

3. Verify queries execute without errors and return expected results.
