# Where to Get More Help

This page guides you on escalating setup issues and finding support resources for GORM CLI. Beyond your initial successful generation and validation, it empowers you to troubleshoot independently, seek community assistance, and leverage official documentation to resolve common and advanced challenges.

---

## 1. Understanding Common Problem Sources

Before reaching out, it's often effective to self-diagnose using these focused checkpoints:

- **Installation Errors**: Check your Go version, environment path, and the CLI installation status.
- **Configuration Issues**: Validate your `genconfig.Config` setup for syntax and proper placement.
- **SQL Template Mistakes**: Confirm your SQL annotations in interfaces are syntactically correct and follow template DSL.
- **Permission or File Path Problems**: Verify file and directory permissions, and that input/output paths are correct.

The [Common Setup and Generation Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting-help/common-issues) page covers these in detail with actionable fixes.

## 2. Official Documentation and Guides

The documentation is comprehensive and structured to help you at every step:

- **Installation & Setup**: Follow [Installing GORM CLI](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-gorm-cli) and [System Requirements](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) for foundational setup.
- **Configuration & Running**: Consult [Initial Project Setup](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/initial-project-setup), [Configuring Code Generation](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/configuring-generation), and [Running the Generator](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/running-the-generator).
- **Validation**: Use [Validating a Successful Setup](/getting-started/configuration-quickstart/validating-first-run) to confirm your results.

These guides build your expertise step-by-step and typically resolve most questions you encounter.

## 3. Community & External Resources

Tap into vibrant communities and official platforms for support:

- **GitHub Repository**: 
  - Report issues or browse existing bug reports at [gorm/cli GitHub Issues](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/issues).
  - Study source code and examples to deepen understanding: [gorm/cli Repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli).

- **GORM Official Site**: 
  - Comprehensive ORM documentation and related toolsets at [https://gorm.io](https://gorm.io).

- **Go Programming Community**:
  - Engage with forums like [Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/golang).

- **Chat & Discussion**:
  - Participate in GORM's official Gophers Slack channels or Discord where users and maintainers collaborate.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Seeking Help

When escalating issues or asking for help, provide:

- A clear description of your environment: OS, Go version, and GORM CLI version.
- Your `genconfig.Config` and relevant interface/model snippets.
- Exact error messages and stack traces.
- Steps to reproduce the problem, including commands and outputs.

This enables faster and more accurate assistance.

## 5. Troubleshooting Beyond First Run

If you encounter challenges after successfully generating code, consider:

- **Refreshing Dependencies:** Run `go mod tidy` and ensure dependencies are up to date.
- **Clearing the Output Directory:** Remove old generated files before re-running to avoid conflicts.
- **Validating Generated Code:** Use your IDE or `go build` to catch syntax errors early.
- **Incremental Configuration:** Change one setting or interface at a time to isolate issues.

## 6. Getting Professional or Enterprise Support

For mission-critical projects needing dedicated help:

- Consider engaging experienced Go/GORM developers or consultants.
- Monitor the GORM community announcements for any upcoming support or training services.
