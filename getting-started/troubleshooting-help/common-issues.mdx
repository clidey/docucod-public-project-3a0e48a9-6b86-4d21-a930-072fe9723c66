# Common Setup and Generation Issues

Quick solutions to typical installation, configuration, and code generation errors, including Go version mismatches, missing configuration, and permission issues. Get unstuck fast.

---

## 1. Go Version Mismatch

### Issue
The GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** for generics support. Running with an older Go version causes installation and runtime errors.

### How to Check Your Go Version
Run:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output (version 1.18+):

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

### Solution
- Upgrade Go to the latest stable version.
- Confirm your `PATH` and environment variables point to the upgraded Go bin directory.

### Troubleshooting
- If `go version` still shows an older version after upgrading, check your system's environment variables and PATH order.

<Tip>
Always use the official Go downloads page [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) or your OS package manager for the latest Go installation.
</Tip>

## 2. GORM CLI Installation Errors

### Common Symptoms
- `command not found: gorm` after installation
- Errors when running `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Run Installation Command**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

2. **Verify `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH**

The binary is installed to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` by default. Ensure this directory is added to your shell's PATH.

For example, add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

3. **Verify Installation**

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected: Displays the GORM CLI usage and commands.

### Troubleshooting

- If installing fails due to network issues, check proxy settings.
- On Windows, prefer using PowerShell or command prompt with administrator privileges.


## 3. Missing or Incorrect Configuration

### Symptoms
- Generated code files are empty or missing expected structs and methods.
- CLI runs without error but output is incomplete.

### Cause
- Missing or malformed `genconfig.Config` in the package.
- Incorrect `OutPath` or generation filters (`IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeStructs`) that filter out needed types.

### How to Diagnose

- Verify if a valid `genconfig.Config` struct is declared in your package, for example:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "./generated",
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
    IncludeStructs: []any{"User", models.User{}},
}
```

- Check that the `OutPath` directory exists and is writable.

### Solution

1. Add or update `genconfig.Config` with correct paths and filters.
2. Ensure your interfaces and structs you want to generate match the include/exclude patterns.
3. Remove restrictive excludes that might skip your target types.

### Tips
- Leave filter lists empty to generate all by default.
- Use wildcard patterns (`"Query*"`, `"User*"`) to simplify inclusion.

## 4. Permission Denied Errors on Generation

### Symptoms
- Errors like `permission denied` or `cannot create file` when running `gorm gen`.

### Diagnosis
- Target output directory lacks write permissions.
- File system restrictions (e.g., read-only mounts).

### Fix

- Change directory permissions:

```bash
chmod -R u+w ./generated
```

- Run CLI with sufficient user permissions.
- Use a directory in your home space or workspace where you have full rights.

## 5. Unsupported or Missing Go Modules

### Symptoms
- Errors about missing dependencies or import failures when running generation or after.

### Cause
- Your Go project is not properly initialized with Go modules.
- Modules are not downloaded or out of sync.

### Fix

- Initialize Go modules if needed:

```bash
go mod init your-module-name
```

- Download dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

- Verify no errors during `go mod tidy`.

## 6. Code Generation Output Does Not Reflect Model Changes

### Reason
- Generated code is based on model and interface source files. If these aren't saved or located properly, output will not update.

### Steps to Remedy

- Ensure you save your model and interface files before running generation.
- Confirm the `-i` input path points to the correct directory with your updated source code.
- Clean the output directory before regeneration to avoid stale files.

```bash
rm -rf ./generated/*
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

## 7. Running Generator Fails Without Error Messages

### Diagnostic Tips
- Run CLI with verbose/debug mode if supported to get detailed logs.
- Check Go environment and CLI installation correctness.
- Examine your SQL template comments for syntax errors or unsupported directives.

## 8. Common SQL Template Errors

### Problems
- Template parsing fails.
- Generated code compiles with errors referencing SQL.

### Tips

- Ensure SQL templates inside interface comments use supported directives (`@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, etc.)
- Avoid malformed Go comments or incorrect placeholders.
- For example, the following is valid:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

- Check for unescaped special characters or misplaced quotes.

## 9. Troubleshooting Workflow Summary

### Step-by-Step

1. Confirm Go version is 1.18 or greater.
2. Verify GORM CLI is installed and executable.
3. Check `genconfig.Config` presence and validity.
4. Ensure file system permissions allow code generation.
5. Confirm input (`-i`) and output (`-o`) paths are correct.
6. Validate SQL template syntax in query interfaces.
7. Run `gorm gen` and inspect output logs.
8. Test generated code compilation and integration.
