# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses the most common problems new users encounter when setting up and running GORM CLI for the first time. It provides clear, actionable steps to identify and resolve issues related to Go environment mismatches, import conflicts, missing dependencies, and generator errors — ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.

---

## 1. Go Version Mismatch

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** because it relies on generics support introduced in Go 1.18.

### How to Check Your Go Version

Run:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output example:

```bash
go version go1.20 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is older than 1.18, upgrade to the latest stable Go release before proceeding.

### Upgrading Go

Download and install the latest Go version from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).

<Warning>
Using unsupported Go versions will lead to build errors and failed generation commands.
Always confirm and upgrade your Go environment before installation.
</Warning>

---

## 2. Installation Problems

If `gorm` command is not found after installation or fails:

### Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`

Check your shell environment:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If missing, add (for bash):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Then reopen your terminal or source your shell profile.

### Confirm Installation

Run:

```bash
gorm version
```

If it outputs version info, installation succeeded.

### Reinstall if Needed

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

<Note>
If you experience permission errors during install, ensure your Go environment is set up without requiring elevated privileges.
</Note>

## 3. Import and Package Path Issues

GORM CLI processes your Go files and packages to generate type-safe code. Import path errors or mismatches in package declarations cause failures.

### Common Symptoms

- Parser errors like "cannot find package"
- Unresolved imports during generation
- Generated code referencing unexpected packages

### Resolution Steps

1. **Verify your project's module structure:** Make sure `go.mod` is correctly initialized and includes all packages you generate.

2. **Packages and directory structure:** Ensure Go package declarations match folder paths.

3. **Absolute vs relative paths:** Use consistent import paths. Prefer absolute module paths when referencing other packages.

4. **Regenerate after adjusting paths:** Run `gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./output` after fixing imports.

<Warning>
Avoid having multiple packages with conflicting names or cyclic imports within the input directory.
</Warning>

## 4. Missing or Incorrect `genconfig.Config` Declarations

Though optional, `genconfig.Config` controls generator behavior such as output path, inclusion filters, and field mappings.

### Common Issues

- Config placed outside of the package to generate
- Misconfigured `IncludeInterfaces` or `ExcludeStructs` filters leading to no generated code
- Misusing `FileLevel` causing partial generation

### How to Fix

- Declare `var _ = genconfig.Config{}` at package level in the same directory as interfaces and models.

- Review and adjust filters to include your interfaces and structs.

- For file-level config, ensure it is intentional and matches your directory layout.

Example snippet:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "generated",
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
}
```

---

## 5. Generator Command Fails or Generates No Code

Run the generator with:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

### Checkpoints

- Confirm `-i` input path points to directory or file containing your SQL-annotated interfaces.

- Confirm interfaces have proper method comments with SQL templates.

- Confirm no syntax errors in your Go source files.

- Check whether the generator outputs informational messages like "Skipping generated file" which may indicate ignored input.

### Common Fixes

- Ensure interfaces have SQL comment annotations; otherwise, generator skips them.

- Remove or correct invalid Go code in the input path.

- Review inclusion/exclusion in `genconfig.Config` if present.

---

## 6. Context Parameter Issues in Interface Methods

GORM CLI auto-injects `context.Context` in generated method signatures if missing.

### Possible Issues

- If your method signature has inconsistent context usage, you may get compilation errors.

### Recommendation

- Include `ctx context.Context` explicitly as the first parameter in interface methods for clarity and to avoid confusion:

```go
GetByID(ctx context.Context, id int) (T, error)
```

- Otherwise, rely on GORM CLI's auto-injection, but be aware of the insertion.

---

## 7. Common Runtime Errors in Generated Code

### Errors Loading Generated Code

- Missing imports in your consuming project— ensure you import the generated package correctly.

- Version mismatch between GORM CLI and `gorm.io/gorm` dependency.

### Association Helper Errors

- Verify association fields and tags in your models to match GORM conventions.

- Wrong or missing `gen:"..."` tags may cause incorrect field helper generation.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Verbose Logging:** Run generation commands in a verbose environment if possible, or add debug prints to observe generator behavior.

- **Check Go Modules:** Run `go mod tidy` to fix dependency mismatches.

- **Validate Model and Interface Syntax:** Test compiling your Go source files independent of the generator.

- **Review Output Directories:** Generated files overwrite if the output directory matches the input.

- **Isolate Issues:** Generate code for the minimal interface and model set to narrow down problems.

---

## 9. Support and Resources

- Check out the [Installation and Validation](./quick-validation) guides for setup verification.

- Review detailed [Preparing Your Models and Interfaces](./prepare-code) instructions to avoid input errors.

- Consult [Running the Generator](./run-generator) for usage nuances.

- Use the [Issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/issues) for reporting problems.

---

## Example: Fixing a Common "No Code Generated" Scenario

1. Confirm your interface has SQL templates in comments.

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

2. Check the interface is included (if using config with filters).

3. Run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

4. Inspect terminal output for warnings and confirm generated files appear.
