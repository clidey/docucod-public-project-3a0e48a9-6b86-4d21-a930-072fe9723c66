# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide provides practical solutions to frequent installation and generation problems encountered when using GORM CLI. Whether you face version mismatches, missing dependencies, or unexpected generation outputs, this page helps you resolve these early blockers swiftly to get your workflow back on track.

---

## 1. Common Installation Problems

### 1.1 Version Mismatch or Unsupported Go Version

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** due to its reliance on generics. If you see errors related to Go version or unsupported syntax:

**Solution:**

- Verify your Go version:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

- If the version is below 1.18, upgrade Go by following the official download instructions: https://golang.org/dl/

- After upgrade, ensure your environment uses the updated Go binary (`which go` or `go env GOROOT`) and restart your shell.

---

### 1.2 `go install` Fails or CLI Is Not Found

If installation via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` fails or you get `command not found`:

**Check:**

- Your `GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory is in your system `PATH`.

- If not, add it to your environment:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- Verify installation with:

  ```bash
  gorm version
  ```

**Tip:** On CI/build systems or constrained environments, ensure network access to download the package.

---

### 1.3 Dependency or Module Errors During Generation

You might encounter issues if dependencies like `gorm.io/gorm` or required database drivers are absent or mismatched:

**Fix:**

- Run `go mod tidy` in your project directory to fetch/update dependencies.

- Confirm that your `go.mod` file includes compatible versions of `gorm.io/gorm` matching your project requirements.

- Check for error messages relating to missing or incompatible packages and resolve accordingly.


---

## 2. Generation Issues and Output Verification

### 2.1 Running Generator Subcommand

Use the following command to generate code in your project:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./path/to/generated/output
```

- `-i` points to the directory with your interface and model definitions.
- `-o` sets where generated files are saved.

### 2.2 Verifying Generation Success

After running, you should see:

- No error output on the console.
- Generated `.go` files appear in the specified output directory.
- Generated files begin with the standard header comment:

  ```go
  // Code generated by 'gorm.io/cli/gorm'. DO NOT EDIT.
  ```

- Confirm that interfaces and models you defined have corresponding generated implementations.

### 2.3 Common Symptoms of Failed or Partial Generation

- No generated files appear.
- Generated files are empty or partial.
- Errors mentioning unrecognized or missing interfaces/structs.

**Fixes:**

- Ensure your interface Go files contain SQL templates in method comments.
- Confirm your `genconfig.Config` does not exclude required interfaces or structs unintentionally.
- Check if your package directory contains proper Go build files.
- Try running with verbose logging (if supported) or check CLI error messages for clues.

---

## 3. Troubleshooting Template Syntax Errors

Errors during parsing or generation often relate to malformed SQL templates in interface comments.

**Tips:**

- SQL templates must use defined placeholder patterns:
  - `@@table` for table name
  - `@@column` for dynamic columns
  - `@param` for Go parameters
  - Template directives like `{{where}} {{if}} {{else}} {{for}}` must be well-formed and properly closed.

- Avoid typos or unbalanced braces in your comments.

- Refer to the Template DSL examples to validate your syntax.


---

## 4. Usage Verification and Sample Test

To confirm everything is working, run the provided test script (if included in your source):

```bash
./scripts/test_all.sh
```

This script runs `go test` on your modules and examples, verifying that generated code compiles and works as expected.

**If tests fail:**

- Review error messages carefully, fix any interface or model issues.
- Check that your generated code is up to date.

---

## 5. Additional Best Practices

- Use package-level configuration (`genconfig.Config`) to control generation scope and output paths;
  this avoids conflicts and accidentally omitting your intended targets.

- Commit your generated files if you rely on clean reproducible builds.

- Use interface-driven query APIs and inspect generated code for learning how templates translate to actual Go code.
