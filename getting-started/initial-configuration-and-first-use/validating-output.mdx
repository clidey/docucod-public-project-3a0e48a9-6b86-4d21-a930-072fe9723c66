# Validating Your Output & Running Your First Query

This guide helps you confidently verify that your GORM CLI code generation was successful and shows you how to run your first database query using the generated APIs. By following these steps, you will ensure your generated code aligns with your models and query interfaces and can execute type-safe, fluent queries as expected.

---

## 1. Confirm Generated Code Presence

Once you run the `gorm gen` command with your input interfaces and models, the generated code should appear in your specified output directory (default is `./g`).

### Steps to Confirm:

- Navigate to your output directory (e.g., `cd ./generated` if you used `-o ./generated`).
- Check for new `.go` files that correspond to your source packages.
- Ensure generated files include:
  - Query API implementations derived from your interfaces
  - Model field helpers exposing typesafe fields and association helpers

<Tip>
If no files appear, verify that your input path (`-i`) correctly points to a Go package or file containing your interfaces and models.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Verify Package & Build Integrity

Before running your application or tests, ensure the generated code compiles without errors.

### Steps:

- Run `go build ./...` or the relevant command for your project.
- Address any compilation errors, which most commonly arise from:
  - Missing or unresolved imports
  - Misconfigured or missing `genconfig.Config` affecting code inclusion
  - Out-of-date or partial generation

<Warning>
Build errors after generation typically indicate configuration issues or source code mismatches. Recheck your interface definitions, model structs, and generation flags.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Import Generated APIs into Your Application Code

To use the generated APIs, import the generated package(s) in your Go code where you intend to perform database queries.

For example: 

```go
import (
  "context"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "your_project/generated" // Adjust to your output path
)
```

Be sure your module and import paths align with your project structure.

---

## 4. Running Your First Query

We’ll walk through executing a simple query to retrieve data by ID, leveraging the generated code.

### Example Setup:

Assume you have the following model and interface defined:

```go
// Model
package models

type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
  Age  int
}

// Query Interface
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}
```

After running generation with `gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated`, you can use the generated API like this:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "your_project/generated" // modify to your actual path
  "your_project/models"
)

func main() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("test.db"), &gorm.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect database")
  }

  // Use the generated Query API for User
  queryAPI := generated.Query[models.User](db)

  user, err := queryAPI.GetByID(ctx, 1)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error fetching user: %v\n", err)
    return
  }

  fmt.Printf("User: %+v\n", user)
}
```

### Outcome:
- Upon running, this will execute a SQL query equivalent to:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1;
  ```

- The returned `user` is a strongly typed `models.User` struct filled with the queried data.

<Tip>
Replace `sqlite.Open("test.db")` and connection details with your actual database driver and DSN.
</Tip>

## 5. Interpreting Results and Verifying Behavior

- A successful query returns the expected record or an empty result with no error.
- If no record matches, expect a "record not found" error — handle it explicitly in your code.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Tips">
<Accordion title="Generated Code Not Found or Empty Output">
- Validate that your input path contains Go interfaces and models.
- Confirm `genconfig.Config` doesn’t exclude your interfaces/structs unintentionally.
- Check for errors reported by the generation command.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build or Import Errors">
- Ensure your Go module paths and import paths are consistent.
- Run `go mod tidy` to clean and update dependencies.
- Make sure all dependencies like `gorm.io/gorm` are installed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Query Returns Errors or No Data">
- Verify database connection and schema.
- Confirm your database has the expected test data.
- Review generated SQL via logging by enabling GORM logger.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

- Explore more complex queries using other generated methods from your interfaces.
- Leverage field helpers for building conditions in a type-safe manner.
- Review the [Quick Start: From Models to Queries](https://gorm.io/cli/docs/overview/quickstart-features/quickstart-workflow) for comprehensive examples.
- Consult the [Template DSL Tutorial](https://gorm.io/cli/docs/guides/query-and-model-helpers/template-dsl-tutorial) to master dynamic queries.

---

## Summary
By confirming the presence and correctness of your generated code, importing it properly, and running your first query, you validate your GORM CLI setup end to end. This process ensures that your application can now benefit from type-safe, fluent database interactions generated automatically from your Go interfaces and models.
