# Prerequisites & Requirements for GORM CLI

Welcome to the starting point for using the GORM CLI tool. Before generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers, ensure your environment meets the necessary requirements. This guide walks you through system and software prerequisites, dependency checks, and basic project expectations to guarantee a smooth setup and successful code generation.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

GORM CLI requires **Go version 1.18 or higher**. This is essential because GORM CLI leverages Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, to generate type-safe query APIs.

### Verify Your Go Version

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your version is older than 1.18, update to a newer Go version from the official [Go downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

<Warning>
Using older Go versions will prevent GORM CLI from generating code properly since generics are fundamental to its design.
</Warning>

---

## 2. Dependencies

### GORM ORM

GORM CLI integrates tightly with the [GORM ORM](https://gorm.io/). Ensure your project uses **gorm.io/gorm** as its ORM dependency.

### GORM CLI Installation

Install the GORM CLI binary using the Go command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

After installation, verify the CLI is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see a usage guide that confirms the CLI version and available commands.

<Info>
The CLI executable is installed into your Go bin directory, usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`. Ensure this directory is in your system PATH to run `gorm` commands globally.
</Info>

---

## 3. Project Structure and Expectations

To use GORM CLI effectively, your project should follow these basic guidelines:

- **Models and Query Interfaces in Go:** Place your Go structs (models) and the interfaces annotated with SQL templates in the same package or directory. This enables the CLI to parse both for code generation.

- **SQL Template Annotations:** Interface methods should carry raw SQL or templated SQL comments that map parameters and define queries. See the [example interfaces](https://gorm.io/cli/examples/query.go) for guidance.

- **Go Modules Enabled:** GORM CLI expects your project to be based on [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).

---

## 4. Environment Compatibility

Ensure your development environment supports the following:

- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or Windows are supported where Go can be installed.
- **Network:** If installing Go dependencies or the CLI via `go install`, the system should have internet access.

---

## 5. Optional but Recommended Tools

- **Cobra CLI Library:** GORM CLI uses Cobra internally, but no action is needed; it comes bundled.

- **Code Editor with Go Support:** IDEs like VSCode, GoLand, or vim with Go plugins improve the editing experience.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Found or Outdated">
- Run `go version` to confirm.
- If outdated, download and install from https://go.dev/dl/.
- Restart your terminal or IDE after upgrade.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="gorm Command Not Recognized">
- Confirm CLI installed via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Check that your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your system PATH.
- Retry opening a new terminal session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Project Files Not Detected by CLI">
- Ensure models and interfaces are in the directory path provided to `gorm gen`.
- Confirm your interface code includes raw SQL annotations in comments.
- Example interface and model setup can be found in `/examples/query.go`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Summary and Next Steps

Once your environment is ready:

1. Install GORM CLI.
2. Prepare your models and annotated Go interfaces.
3. Proceed to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation-guide) to generate code.

For detailed examples, see [Defining Models and Query Interfaces](/getting-started/first-run-and-validation/create-models-and-interfaces) and learn about running the CLI in [Running the Code Generator](/getting-started/first-run-and-validation/run-code-generation).

## Example: Verify Your Setup Quickly

```bash
go version
# Ensure Go 1.18+
gorm --help
# Shows CLI usage and confirms installation
```

If these commands run without errors and show expected output, your prerequisites are satisfied.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Tip>
**Why is Go 1.18 required?**

GORM CLI depends on Go generics to generate type-safe and fluent APIs, a feature introduced in Go 1.18.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Can I use GORM CLI without existing models?**

Models are necessary for generating field helpers — you can still generate query interfaces but the full benefit arrives with models.
</Note>

<Warning>
Skipping proper setup may cause generation failures or invalid code — address dependencies and tools first.
</Warning>
