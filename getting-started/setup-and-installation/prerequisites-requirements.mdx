# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your development environment correctly to use GORM CLI effectively. This guide covers the essential system requirements, Go version dependencies, supported platforms, integration needs with GORM, and environment preparation tips.

---

## 1. System Requirements

To run GORM CLI smoothly, ensure your system meets the following minimum specifications:

- **Operating System:** Any OS that supports Go 1.18 or higher, including Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Go Language Version:** Go 1.18 or later (required for generics support)
- **Disk Space:** At least 50 MB free for installing CLI and generated code
- **Memory:** Minimum 512 MB RAM (more is recommended for large projects)

This minimal footprint means GORM CLI is lightweight and compatible with typical developer workstations.


## 2. Go Environment Requirements

GORM CLI is a Go code generation tool relying on language features introduced in Go version 1.18:

- **Mandatory Go 1.18+:** GORM CLI requires generics; versions prior to 1.18 do not support these features and will fail.
- **Go Modules Enabled:** The project and CLI execution should use Go modules for dependency management.
- **GOPATH Not Required:** CLI works outside GOPATH environments.

**Verify your Go Version:**

```bash
go version
```
Expected output should be `go version go1.18` or higher.


## 3. Platform Compatibility

- GORM CLI supports all platforms where Go 1.18+ is supported.
- Tested platforms include:
  - Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
  - macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
  - Windows (64-bit)


## 4. Integration Requirements with GORM

GORM CLI generates code tailored for projects using GORM v2, so ensure compatibility:

- **Use GORM v2:** If your project does not use GORM v2 (the module `gorm.io/gorm`), the generated code will not function properly.
- **Go Modules Dependency:** Your project must manage dependencies with Go Modules including GORM.
- **Database Drivers:** Ensure you have the appropriate database driver installed and configured for your GORM project (e.g., `gorm.io/driver/postgres`).


## 5. Network and Permissions

- **No Network Required:** GORM CLI runs locally; no internet access is needed after installation.
- **Installation Permissions:** Ensure you have permission to install binaries and write to your target output directories.


## 6. Installing Go and GORM CLI

If you have not already installed Go:

- Download and install the latest Go release from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Confirm Go is successfully installed and in your PATH.

Install GORM CLI with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This installs the `gorm` executable to your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory.


## 7. Preparing Your Project

Before generating code, arrange your project as follows:

- **Set Go Modules:** Initialize your project with `go mod init` if not already done.
- **Add GORM v2:**

    ```bash
    go get gorm.io/gorm
    ```

- **Organize Models and Interfaces:** Put your Go structs representing database models and your query interfaces together in the same package or directory.

- **Configure genconfig if Needed:** Optional â€” You can define `genconfig.Config` at package-level for customized generation paths and mapping.


## 8. Verification Checklist

Ensure:

- Go 1.18+ is installed and accessible
- Your project uses GORM v2 and modules
- Correct platform and OS for Go
- Permissions to install and write files


## 9. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Pitfalls and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Go Version Older than 1.18">
Check Go version with `go version`. If older, download and install the latest Go from the official [Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing GORM v2 Module">
Run `go get gorm.io/gorm` in your project root to add GORM v2 dependency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied on Installation or Directory">
Make sure you have write permissions for `$GOPATH/bin` or your specified binary directory and the target output folder where generated code will be saved. Consider running with elevated privileges or adjusting directory permissions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unsupported Platform or Architecture">
Verify your platform is supported by Go 1.18+. Check official Go support matrix at https://go.dev/doc/install#supported-platforms.
</Accordion>

## 10. Next Steps

Once your environment is confirmed ready, proceed with installing GORM CLI (if not done) and running your first code generation:

- Follow the [Installing GORM CLI](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation) guide
- Verify installation with the [First Run and Installation Validation](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/first-run-validation) instructions
