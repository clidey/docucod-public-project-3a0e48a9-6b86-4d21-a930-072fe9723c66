# First Run and Installation Validation

Welcome to the final checkpoint after installing GORM CLI. This guide ensures your installation is correct, the CLI is operational, and provides you with immediate steps to verify and interact with GORM CLI for the first time.

---

## 1. Confirm Your GORM CLI Installation

Before proceeding to use the tool, verify that the installation was successful and GORM CLI is available in your system PATH.

### 1.1 Check GORM CLI Version

Run the following command in your terminal to confirm that the CLI is installed and accessible:

```bash
gorm version
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- The CLI prints the current installed version.
- If you see a "command not found" or similar error, the installation or `$PATH` configuration needs correction.

> If you installed GORM CLI using `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` as recommended, ensure that your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is part of your PATH environment variable.

### 1.2 Access CLI Help

To familiarize yourself with available GORM CLI commands and options, use the help command:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see a list of commands, including the `gen` command for code generation.

<Tip>
If unsure about any command, add the `--help` flag to get detailed usage insights, for example: `gorm gen --help`.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Run Basic Command to Validate Installation

The most direct way to validate your setup is to invoke the code generation command against a known source directory that contains your query interfaces and model structs.

**Example:**

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i ./examples` specifies the input directory containing Go interfaces and model definitions.
- `-o ./generated` is the output directory where generated code will be placed.

### 2.1 Expected Output During Generation

You should observe logs similar to:

```
Generating file generated/query.go from examples/query.go...
Generating file generated/models.go from examples/models.go...
```

This indicates that your GORM CLI correctly parsed your input files and generated the corresponding Go code.

### 2.2 Verify Generated Files

Confirm that the `./generated` directory now contains Go source files with generated typesafe APIs and field helpers.

<Tip>
If no files are generated, check your input directory for valid query interfaces and model structs. Refer to the [Defining Models and Query Interfaces](./prepare-models-interfaces) page.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Validate CLI Operation with Help and Version

### 3.1 Run the Root Command

Execute:

```bash
gorm
```

This should print basic usage information and list available subcommands like `gen`.

### 3.2 Run Subcommands Without Arguments

Try:

```bash
gorm gen
```

You should see a usage message about required flags, confirming that the CLI command is wired and functional.

## 4. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found Error">
Make sure the Go bin directory where GORM CLI is installed is in your system PATH.

For example, add the following to your shell profile:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

On Windows, add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` to your PATH environment variable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied During Install">
Run the install command with proper permissions or switch to a user directory with write access:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Avoid using `sudo` with Go installs.

Check your Go environment with `go env` to verify installation paths.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Generated Files After Running `gorm gen`">
- Confirm your input directory has Go source files with valid interfaces and structs.
- Check for typos or compiler errors in your Go code.
- Verify no conflicting `genconfig.Config` excludes your files from the generation.
- Run with verbose or debug logs if available.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps After Validation

- Proceed to [Defining Models and Query Interfaces](../core-workflow-quickstart/prepare-models-interfaces) to prepare your Go code for generation.
- Explore [Generating Type-Safe APIs and Helpers](../core-workflow-quickstart/generate-api) to understand code generation workflows.
- Use [Using Generated APIs: First Query](../core-workflow-quickstart/using-generated-code) to write your first data query using generated code.

<Check>
Successful CLI validation means you’re ready to leverage GORM CLI’s full capabilities for generating typesafe query APIs and field helpers.

## Appendix: Quick CLI Validation Commands

```bash
# Check CLI version
gorm version

# Display CLI help
gorm --help

# Display help for the code generator
gorm gen --help

# Run code generation on examples to verify output
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Check generated files
ls ./generated
```
