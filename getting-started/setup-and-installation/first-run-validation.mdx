# Validating Your Installation

Confirming that GORM CLI is properly installed and accessible in your environment is a crucial step to avoid issues during your development workflow. This guide provides straightforward, actionable commands and checks to quickly verify your setup and troubleshoot common problems related to path configurations and tool availability.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Installation

Start by checking if the GORM CLI binary is correctly installed and accessible from your command line.

### Step 1: Confirm `gorm` Command Availability

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

**Expected outcome:**
- You should see a help message displaying usage instructions and available commands such as `gen`.
- If you get an error like `command not found` or similar, the CLI tool is either not installed or not in your system's PATH.

### Step 2: Check Installed Version

To confirm the installed version of GORM CLI, run:

```bash
gorm version
```

**What this means:**
- This verifies the CLI binary is operational.
- Although the `version` subcommand may not print a version in all builds, the absence of execution errors is a good indicator.


<Note>
If the `gorm` command is not found, review your Go environment and PATH settings. Typically, you install GORM CLI with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Ensure that your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` directory is included in your PATH environment variable.
</Note>

---

## 2. Run a Basic Command to Validate

The `gen` subcommand is the core code generator of GORM CLI. Running it with the `--help` flag checks if the generator is set up correctly.

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

**Expected outcome:**
- You should see detailed usage instructions, flag descriptions such as `-i --input` and `-o --output`, and examples.

---

## 3. Quick Functional Test (Optional)

To completely validate your installation and environment, including Go modules and dependencies, you can run tests shipped with the CLI source repository.

Assuming you have the source repository cloned locally, navigate to its root directory and execute:

```bash
./scripts/test_all.sh
```

### What this script does:
- Runs all Go tests for the root module and the example module
- Validates your Go environment (Go 1.18+ required)
- Verifies functional integrity of core commands

**Expected output:**
- Messages like "Running root module tests..." and "Running examples module tests..."
- No test failures or panic messages
- Ends with "Done." indicating successful execution

<Tip>
If you encounter permission issues running the script, ensure it’s executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/test_all.sh
```

If tests fail, check your Go version and ensure dependencies are resolved.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found or Not Recognized">
- Ensure the `gorm` binary is installed via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Confirm that your PATH includes the directory where Go installs binaries (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).
- Restart your terminal or reload your shell environment after updating PATH.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors When Running Scripts">
- Use `chmod +x ./scripts/test_all.sh` to make the test script executable.
- Run script from correct directory: the root of the cloned repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Issues or Missing Dependencies">
- Verify Go version with `go version`; must be 1.18 or higher.
- Run `go mod tidy` in the CLI repo to fetch missing dependencies.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps After Validation

Once validation passes, you’re ready to proceed with GORM CLI usage:

- Define your Go query interfaces and models with SQL annotations (see [Basic Configuration & First Generation](/getting-started/configure-and-generate/basic-config)).
- Generate your first code artifacts using `gorm gen` (see [Generating Code: Your First Workflow](/getting-started/configure-and-generate/first-generation)).
- Integrate generated code into your GORM project (see [Integrating Generated Code](/getting-started/configure-and-generate/project-integration)).

<Tip>
Refer to the [Installation (All Platforms)](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation) guide if you need to reinstall or upgrade the CLI.
</Tip>

---

## Summary
- Ensure the `gorm` CLI tool is installed and in your PATH.
- Validate command availability and help output.
- Optionally, run bundled tests to confirm full setup integrity.
- Use troubleshooting tips to resolve common setup errors.
- Begin your development workflow by generating and integrating code.
