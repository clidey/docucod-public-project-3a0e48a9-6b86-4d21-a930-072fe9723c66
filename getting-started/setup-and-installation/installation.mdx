# Installing GORM CLI

This guide walks you through installing the GORM CLI tool step-by-step using Go's tooling to enable seamless generation of type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers for your GORM projects.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later (required for generics support).
- **Supported Platforms**: Any platform supported by Go 1.18+ (Linux, MacOS, Windows).
- **GORM Version**: Compatible with GORM v2 (gorm.io/gorm).
- **Network Access**: Internet access to fetch Go modules from public repositories.

<Tip>
If you have not installed Go 1.18+, follow the official Go installation guide at https://golang.org/doc/install before proceeding.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

GORM CLI installs as a standard Go binary module. Follow these steps to fetch and install the latest version.

### Step 1: Fetch and Install via `go install`

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads the latest GORM CLI source, compiles it, and installs the executable in your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

### Step 2: Add Go bin directory to your system PATH

If not already done, add your Go bin directory to your shell PATH environment variable to run `gorm` directly:

- **Linux/macOS (bash/zsh)**:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
```

<Tip>
Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc` after updating PATH.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Check that GORM CLI installed correctly by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see output describing available commands including `gen` for code generation:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```

<Check>
If you see the usage output, your installation was successful.
</Check>

## 3. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### Issue: `gorm` command not found

- Ensure your Go bin directory is added to your system PATH.
- Verify the location of the `gorm` executable:

```bash
which gorm
```

or on Windows:

```powershell
Get-Command gorm
```

- Confirm that Go installed correctly by running `go version`.

### Issue: Go version too old

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer. Check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Upgrade to the latest version from https://golang.org/dl/ if needed.

### Issue: Network or module fetch errors

- Confirm you have internet access.
- Check your Go proxy environment variables; temporarily try disabling proxy:

```bash
export GOPROXY=direct
```

- Retry installation with verbose output for more detail:

```bash
go install -v gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### Platform-specific Notes

- **Windows users**: Run PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator if permission errors occur.
- **macOS users**: Make sure your shell configuration file (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) is updated for PATH changes.

## 4. Next Steps After Installation

Once installed, you are ready to generate your first GORM query APIs and field helpers using the CLI.

- Start by defining Go interfaces with SQL templates in your project.
- Use the command:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

- Explore the [Quick Start: Define Models and Interfaces](../core-workflow-quickstart/prepare-models-interfaces) to prepare your code.
- Refer to [First Run and Installation Validation](./first-run-validation) to confirm setup success.
