# Installation (All Platforms) Guide for GORM CLI

This guide provides you with clear, actionable steps to install the GORM CLI tool across different operating systems quickly and reliably. Whether you are using Windows, macOS, or Linux, you will be guided to a smooth installation that enables you to start generating type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers without delay.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Go Environment**: You must have Go version 1.18 or newer installed and properly configured in your system's PATH.
  - To verify, run:
    ```bash
    go version
    ```
    - Expected output example: `go version go1.20.1 darwin/amd64`
- **Operating System Compatibility**: GORM CLI supports all platforms where Go 1.18+ runs, including:
  - Windows
  - macOS
  - Linux
- **Network Access**: Ability to download modules from `gorm.io/cli/gorm` via the Go module system.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have sufficient permissions to install binaries to your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

<Tip>
If `go install` is not recognized, confirm that your Go installation is complete and your PATH environment variable includes your Go bin directory.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Install GORM CLI using `go install`

The recommended, platform-independent method for installing GORM CLI is the `go install` command. It fetches the latest version and places the executable in your Go bin directory.

### Step-by-Step:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your terminal or command prompt">
Open your system’s terminal (macOS/Linux) or command prompt / PowerShell (Windows).
</Step>

<Step title="Run the installation command">
Execute the following command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
This command downloads, builds, and installs the latest GORM CLI executable.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify installation location">
By default, the binary will be installed to:

- `$GOPATH/bin/gorm` (if GOPATH is set)
- Or `$HOME/go/bin/gorm` (default Go bin path)

Ensure that this directory is included in your system PATH.
</Step>

<Step title="Check installation success">
Confirm the CLI installed correctly by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```
You should see the GORM CLI's help output listing available commands such as `gen`.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If you receive a “command not found” error:

- Confirm your Go bin directory is in your PATH.
- Alternatively, run the executable by its full path.
- Restart your terminal session if you modified environment variables.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

- Use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- Add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` to your PATH if not already included.

### macOS / Linux

- Use your preferred shell (bash, zsh, etc.).
- Add `$HOME/go/bin` to your PATH with:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
```
- Add the above line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) for persistence.

<Tip>
Use `which gorm` or `where gorm` to locate the installed executable.
</Tip>

## 4. Confirming Your Installation

After installation, verify that GORM CLI is ready to use with these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm CLI version">
Run:

```bash
gorm --version
```
Expected output includes the CLI version.
</Step>

<Step title="Run help command">
Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```
The output lists commands such as `gen`, confirming the CLI is operational.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
GORM CLI is successfully installed if you can run `gorm --help` and see the available commands.
</Check>

## 5. Getting Started with Your First Command

Once installed, you can immediately begin generating query APIs:

1. Prepare your Go interfaces with SQL templates.
2. Use the generator command:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

3. Build and use the generated code in your project.

Refer to the [Generating Code: Your First Workflow](https://your-doc-domain/getting-started/configure-and-generate/first-generation) guide for detailed examples.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Check if your Go bin directory is in your PATH.

To add it temporarily:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
```

Add this line permanently to your shell profile.

Restart your terminal after changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go Version Is Older Than 1.18">
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer.

Upgrade Go by downloading the latest release from https://go.dev/dl/

Verify the upgrade with `go version`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Permissions To Install">
If you get permission errors, ensure:

- On Linux/macOS, avoid using `sudo` for `go install`.
- Your Go environment is correctly configured with user-writable directories.

Check `$GOPATH` and `$GOBIN` settings with:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Issues During go install">
Ensure you can reach `gorm.io` and fetch Go modules.

Check your proxy settings if behind a corporate firewall.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Useful Tips

- Always install the latest version to get new features and fixes.
- Use explicit version tags in `go install` if you want a specific release.
- Keep your Go toolchain updated regularly.
