# Installation Guide

Step-by-step instructions for installing GORM CLI on your system using Go’s package manager. This guide includes alternative approaches and tips for verifying that the installation is successful.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or higher (required to support generics used by GORM CLI).
- **GORM ORM Dependency:** Your project should already be or will be using the GORM ORM library (`gorm.io/gorm`).
- **Network:** Internet access to download Go modules and the GORM CLI package.

<Tip>
If you haven't installed Go yet or your version is older than 1.18, download the latest version from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Methods

### 2.1 Using `go install` (Recommended)

This is the straightforward way to install the CLI as a standalone binary:

```bash
# Install the latest GORM CLI binary globally
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command compiles and places the `gorm` executable in your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go’s bin directory.
- Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your system PATH to run `gorm` from any location.

#### Verifying Installation

After installation, check the CLI version to confirm success:

```bash
gorm --version
```

Expected output should display the installed version string, confirming the CLI is ready.

<Tip>
If you see "command not found," verify that your Go bin directory is part of your PATH environment variable.
</Tip>

### 2.2 Manual Clone and Build

If you prefer to build from source or want the latest unreleased updates:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.git
cd cli
```

2. Build the CLI tool:

```bash
go build -o gorm ./cmd/gorm
```

3. Move the binary to your PATH location:

```bash
mv gorm /usr/local/bin/  # or another directory in your PATH
```

4. Verify with:

```bash
gorm --version
```

### 2.3 Use Module in Project (Optional)

Instead of a global CLI, you can run it as a Go module command within your project:

```bash
go run gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

This approach skips installation but requires network access on each run.

## 3. Initial Usage Quick Check

Once installed, you can test the generator on example code (assuming you have interfaces with SQL templates ready):

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` specifies the input path containing your Go interfaces.
- `-o` sets the output directory for generated code.

If this completes without error, the CLI is correctly installed and operational.

<Tip>
The CLI command requires the `-i/--input` flag pointing to the directory or Go file with your query interfaces. Running without it will produce an error.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Check that your Go binary path is included in your system’s PATH environment variable. For example:

- On Unix/macOS:
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```
- On Windows, ensure `%GOPATH%\bin` is in your PATH.

After setting PATH, restart your terminal or IDE.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Old">
Run `go version` to verify your Go installation.

If it is older than 1.18, update Go from https://golang.org/dl/ and reinstall.

Older versions will not support generics, causing the install command to fail.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Module Download Fails">
Ensure internet connectivity and that your Go proxy is properly configured.

Try resetting by:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

Or use a different Go proxy:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use Latest Version:** Regularly update with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` to get improvements and bug fixes.
- **Project-Local Outputs:** Use the `-o` flag to direct generated code into your project directory structure for easier integration.
- **Use Go Modules:** Keep your project within a Go module-enabled environment (`go.mod`) for dependency consistency.

## Summary

You are now ready to leverage GORM CLI by installing it efficiently with Go tooling. Once installed, the CLI empowers you to generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers seamlessly integrated with GORM.
