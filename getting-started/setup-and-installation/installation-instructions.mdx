# Installation Instructions

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install **GORM CLI** on your development environment across supported platforms. Follow these actionable steps to set up the tool efficiently and avoid common installation hurdles.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, confirm your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version:** 1.18 or later (required because GORM CLI leverages Go generics)
- **Supported platforms:** Any OS where Go 1.18+ is supported (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Go module support:** Your project should be using Go modules to manage dependencies

<Tip>
Ensure your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` environment variables are configured properly so that `go install` places binaries where your shell can find them.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

Use the official Go installation method to install the latest stable version of GORM CLI:

```bash
# Run this command in your terminal
# This downloads and installs the gorm CLI binary to your Go bin directory

   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### Verification

After installation, verify that `gorm` is accessible and check the installed version:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see usage details indicating the CLI is installed and ready.

---

## 3. Common Installation Issues & Solutions

<Tip>
If `gorm` command is not found after installation, ensure that your Go binary installation directory (typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is included in your system's PATH environment variable.
</Tip>

### Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                                   | Cause                                      | Solution                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `gorm: command not found`                | Go bin directory not in PATH                | Add `$HOME/go/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin` to PATH |
| Installation fails with Go version error | Go version older than 1.18                  | Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or higher       |
| Network issues while running `go install` | Dependency fetch failure                     | Check network access, proxy, or firewall  |
| Permission denied on installation        | Insufficient user permissions                | Run installation with proper user rights   |

## 4. Optional: Installing from Source

For advanced users who want the latest development version or need to modify source code:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-gorm/cli.git
git checkout main
```

2. Build the binary manually:

```bash
cd cli
go build -o gorm ./cmd/gorm
```

3. Place the binary in your executable path or reference it directly.

<Tip>
When installing from source, ensure your environment satisfies the same Go version requirements and module dependencies.
</Tip>

## 5. Post-Installation Steps

With GORM CLI installed, you're ready to generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers for your Go projects using GORM.

Next recommended steps:

- Review [System Requirements](./system-requirements) to confirm environment readiness.
- Proceed to [Basic Configuration](./basic-configuration) to setup `genconfig.Config` if needed.
- Explore your [First Code Generation](../../first-code-generation/defining-models-and-interfaces) guide to start defining models and interfaces.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup title="Installation FAQs">
<Accordion title='Why do I get a "command not found" error after installation?'>
This usually means the Go bin directory (where `gorm` was installed) is not on your PATH. Add `$HOME/go/bin` or your Go bin path to your `PATH` environment variable and restart your terminal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my Go version is older than 1.18?">
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to generics usage. Upgrade your Go installation by visiting https://go.dev/dl/ and follow platform-specific installation instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I install GORM CLI for Windows?">
Yes, the `go install` command supports Windows as long as Go is installed properly. Use your terminal or PowerShell with the same installation command.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I update GORM CLI to the latest version?">
Simply rerun:

```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This upgrades the binary to the newest release.
