# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before diving into using GORM CLI, it’s essential to ensure your environment meets the necessary prerequisites. This preparation guarantees a smooth installation and an efficient workflow when generating type-safe query code for your GORM projects.

---

## 1. Software Requirements

### Go Version

- **Minimum Version:** Go 1.18 or later
- **Reason:** GORM CLI leverages Go generics and other language features introduced in Go 1.18.

<Tip>
If you’re unsure about your Go version, run:

```bash
go version
```

Upgrade Go if the version is below 1.18 to avoid compatibility issues.
</Tip>

### Operating Systems Supported

- GORM CLI works on all platforms supported by Go, including:
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows

No platform-specific versions or binaries are required.

## 2. Installation Dependencies

- **Go Toolchain:** Must be installed and available in your system’s `PATH`.
- **GORM Package:** Since generated code ties directly into GORM v2, ensure your project uses `gorm.io/gorm`.

<Tip>
GORM CLI installs as a Go command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This single command fetches the latest GORM CLI executable compatible with your Go environment.
</Tip>

## 3. Development Environment Considerations

- A working Go module (`go.mod`) setup within your project is recommended to resolve dependencies cleanly.
- Your source files (interfaces and model structs) should be organized in Go packages (folders with package declarations).

## 4. Permissions & Access

- Ensure you have write permissions to the output directory where generated code will reside (default is `./g`).
- Network access is required temporarily for fetching packages using `go install`.

## 5. Resource Requirements

- **Disk Space:** Minimal; generated files are source code only.
- **Memory:** Standard development machine specifications are sufficient.

## 6. Network & Security

- No special firewall or network configurations are necessary beyond normal package download capabilities.

- GORM CLI does not require external services or servers.

## Quick Checklist Before Installation

<Check>
- Go 1.18+ installed and added to PATH
- Your project uses `gorm.io/gorm` v2
- You have a valid Go module initialized
- Sufficient permissions to write generated files
- Network access for installing the CLI
</Check>

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
Check installed Go version with `go version`. Upgrade if necessary by downloading from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Go toolchain">
Ensure Go is properly installed and your `PATH` environment variable includes the Go binary directory. Confirm by running `go version`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient permissions to write generated files">
Make sure your user account has write access to the directory where you plan to generate code, or specify an alternative with the `-o` flag.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network issues ">
If unable to fetch GORM CLI or other dependencies, check your internet connection and firewall settings.
