# System Requirements for GORM CLI

This page details the essential requirements and compatibility considerations you need to use GORM CLI effectively. Understanding these ensures a smooth installation experience and prevents common setup issues related to Go environment and related tooling.

---

## 1. Go Version Compatibility

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** as it leverages Go generics extensively for generating type-safe query APIs and model field helpers.

- **Minimum Go Version:** 1.18
- **Recommended Go Version:** Use the latest stable Go release to benefit from performance improvements and fixes.


<Tip>
Ensure your Go toolchain (compiler, modules, environment) is fully updated and configured correctly before installing or running GORM CLI, as version mismatches can cause unexpected errors.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GORM CLI can be installed and run on all platforms supported by Go, including:

- **Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

Use your platformâ€™s supported version of Go 1.18+.

---

## 3. Installation Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, verify these:

- You have a working **Go 1.18+ environment** with `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` configured correctly.
- Your project uses or supports **Go modules**, enabling dependency management and module-aware builds.
- Access to the internet to fetch GORM CLI (`gorm.io/cli/gorm`) via `go install` command.


<Check>
Run the following command to check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output should look like:

```plaintext
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If the version is below 1.18, update Go before proceeding.
</Check>

## 4. Compatibility Notes and Common Pitfalls

### Generics Requirement

- GORM CLI's core relies on Go generics. Attempting to use it with Go versions &lt;1.18 will fail.

### Module Mode

- Running outside a Go module context or with `GO111MODULE=off` can cause dependency resolution failures.
- Always ensure module mode is enabled (default in Go 1.16+).

### Environment Variables

- `$GOPROXY` and other Go environment variables should be configured properly to allow module fetching.

### Common Setup Issues

| Issue                                             | Cause                                                  | Solution                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `unknown generic type` or syntax errors           | Using Go version below 1.18                            | Upgrade Go to 1.18+                               |
| `cannot find module` or install failure           | Network issues, missing or disabled module proxy      | Configure `GOPROXY`, check internet connection   |
| `command not found` after install                  | `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` not in `$PATH`               | Add Go binary directory to your system `PATH`    |
| `permissions error installing or running`         | Insufficient user permissions or antivirus blocking   | Run with proper permissions, whitelist Go binaries |

<Tip>
Run `go env` if you need to inspect your current Go environment settings to troubleshoot module or path issues.
</Tip>

## 5. Summary Checklist Before Installation

Before proceeding to install and use GORM CLI, confirm the following:

- [ ] Go version is 1.18 or higher (`go version`)
- [ ] You are inside a Go module (`go.mod` present in your working directory or above)
- [ ] Your `$PATH` includes Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`)
- [ ] Internet connectivity for module downloads
- [ ] Correct module proxy settings (if you are behind a firewall or proxy)

<Tip>
If you plan to use GORM CLI with a continuous integration (CI) environment or containers, ensure the environment is configured with Go 1.18+ and proper network access.
</Tip>

## 6. Next Steps

After validating your environment meets these requirements, you are ready to proceed with installing GORM CLI.

- See [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation-instructions)
- For configuring code generation options, refer to [Basic Configuration](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/basic-configuration)
- Start defining your models and query interfaces by following [Defining Models and Query Interfaces](/getting-started/first-code-generation/defining-models-and-interfaces)

## 7. Troubleshooting Common System Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version is Below 1.18">
You may see errors related to generics or syntax during build or run.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade your Go installation to the latest version from https://go.dev/dl/
- Verify with `go version`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go Modules Not Enabled or Improperly Configured">
Errors about missing modules or packages indicate module mode problems.

**Solution:**
- Run inside a directory with a valid `go.mod` file.
- Ensure module mode is enabled:

```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
```
- Run `go mod tidy` to sync dependencies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GOROOT, GOPATH, or PATH Misconfiguration">
Installed binaries not found by the shell.

**Solution:**
- Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or custom `$GOBIN` is in your system PATH.
- Check with:

```bash
echo $PATH
go env GOPATH
```
- Add to path if missing, e.g.:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Issues Fetching Modules">
Behind a corporate proxy or firewall, module fetches may fail.

**Solution:**
- Set `GOPROXY` environment variable:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
- Consult your network administrator if issues persist.
