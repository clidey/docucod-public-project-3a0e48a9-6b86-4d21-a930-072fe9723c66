# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool on different platforms using standard Go tooling. It addresses common issues users might encounter during installation, ensuring a successful setup to start benefiting from type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers right away.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or higher (required for generics support).
- **Operating System:** Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Go environment properly set up:** Your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables should be configured (usually automatic with default Go installation).

### Verify your Go installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```
Replace `linux/amd64` with your platform.

If your Go version is older, upgrade to at least 1.18 before proceeding.

<Tip>
If you don't have Go installed or need to update, visit https://golang.org/dl/ for installation instructions.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

The recommended and official method to install GORM CLI is via the Go `install` command, which downloads and compiles the latest version.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Open your terminal or command line interface**

2. **Run the installation command:**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches the latest GORM CLI source code, builds it, and installs the executable to your `GOBIN` or `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

3. **Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$GOBIN`) is in your system PATH**

On macOS/Linux, check your PATH by running:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If not included, add it by editing your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

On Windows, update the environment variables accordingly.

### Verification

Run the following to confirm GORM CLI is installed:

```bash
gorm --version
```
Expected output (example):

```
GORM CLI Tool version x.y.z
```
If you see an error _command not found_ or similar, review your PATH settings.

<Tip>
If `gorm` command is not found after installation, try restarting your terminal session or manually adding Go binaries to your PATH.
</Tip>

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS / Linux

- Use the terminal.
- Installation and verification steps are the same as above.

### Windows

- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt.
- Verify Go binaries directory (`%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`) is added to your system PATH.

<Tip>
On Windows, run `where gorm` to verify the CLI executable location.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Installation Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems & Solutions">

<Accordion title="GORM CLI command not found after installation">
Check if Go's bin directory is included in your PATH. Run:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

or on Windows

```powershell
echo $Env:PATH
```

and confirm the output includes your Go bin directory.

If not, add it and restart your terminal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is below 1.18">
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ due to generics usage. Upgrade Go by downloading the latest version from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied when installing CLI">
Ensure you are not running as a user without write permission to the Go bin directory.

On Linux/macOS, use sudo sparingly. Instead, configure Go to install binaries under your home directory (`GOBIN` environment variable).

Example:

```bash
export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Firewall or network issues during `go install`">
Verify your network allows Go tooling to fetch modules from the internet. If behind a proxy, configure Go proxy settings.

Example:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>

## 5. Next Steps: Confirm Installation & Begin Using GORM CLI

Once installation is confirmed, you can proceed to configure your projects and generate type-safe APIs. For a quick validation:

- Write a simple query interface.
- Run the CLI command `gorm gen` for code generation.

See the [Project Configuration](./project-configuration) and [Generating Code](./generating-code) guides for detailed instructions.

<Check>
You now have GORM CLI installed, verified, and ready to generate powerful, type-safe database queries and helpers.
</Check>
