# System Requirements

Before you begin using **GORM CLI**, ensure that your development environment meets the following essential requirements. This foundation guarantees smooth installation, configuration, and usage of the tool for generating type-safe, fluent query APIs and model helpers.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

- **Go 1.18 or higher** is mandatory.
  - GORM CLI leverages Go generics, introduced in version 1.18, to provide type safety and expressive APIs.
  - Using versions older than Go 1.18 will result in incompatibility and generation errors.

> Ensure your Go environment is set up and verified with:

```bash
go version
# Expected output: go version go1.18 or newer
```

<Tip>
If you need to update Go, visit the official page: https://golang.org/dl/
</Tip>

---

## 2. System Tooling Requirements

- **Go Toolchain Installed**
  - The `go` command-line tool must be installed and accessible in your system `PATH`.
  - This is required to install the GORM CLI binary and to run code generation.

- **Network Connectivity**
  - Internet access is needed initially to fetch and install the GORM CLI module with `go install`.

- **Filesystem Permissions**
  - Write permissions are needed in your project directory where generated files will be output.
  - The generator creates and updates source code files based on your input interfaces and models.

- **Shell Environment**
  - A POSIX-compliant shell or Command Prompt for running `go install`, `gorm gen`, and other commands.

---

## 3. Recommended Developer Environment

For the best experience using GORM CLI, follow these recommendations:

- **Code Editor with Go Support**
  - Use editors such as VS Code, GoLand, or Vim configured with Go language support.
  - This ensures IntelliSense and validation for generated code and your interfaces/models.

- **Enable Module Mode**
  - Set your project to use Go Modules (`go.mod`) to manage dependencies cleanly.

- **Consistent Go Versioning**
  - Use tools like `gvm`, `asdf`, or containerized builds to lock your environment to Go 1.18+.

- **Version Control**
  - Track generated code via Git or your preferred source control method to manage changes.

## 4. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Check>
- Go version is 1.18 or higher
- `go` tool is installed and available in your PATH
- Your project directory has write permissions
- Network connectivity for initial installation
- Project uses Go Modules for dependency management
</Check>

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Is Too Low or Undefined">
If running `go version` shows older than 1.18 or command not found:
- Upgrade your Go installation to 1.18 or higher.
- Ensure your terminal session picks up the updated Go path.
- Restart your shell and verify `go version` again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cannot Run `go install` or `gorm gen`">
Errors like "command not found" or module fetch failures indicate:
- The Go environment is not installed properly.
- Network issues preventing module download.
- Proxy settings blocking access.

Resolution:
- Reinstall Go from the official site.
- Check network and proxy configurations.
- Try running `go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied Writing Generated Files">
- Verify that you have write access to the directory you specify with `-o` or the default output path.
- Check file permissions and ownership.
- Run commands with appropriate privileges or choose a different directory.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
