# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

When setting up GORM CLI, encountering errors during installation, configuration, or the first code generation run is common. This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent problems so you can proceed smoothly with your workflow.

---

## 1. Installation Issues

### Problem: Go Version Not Supported

**Symptom:** Running `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` or `gorm gen` yields errors about unsupported Go versions.

**Cause:** GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** to support generics.

**Resolution:**
- Verify your Go version:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

  It must report a version >= 1.18.

- Upgrade Go if needed by downloading the latest version from https://golang.org/dl/

> This is critical since GORM CLI leverages Go generics for type-safe APIs.


### Problem: `gorm` command not found after installation

**Symptom:** After installation, typing `gorm` in your terminal results in "command not found".

**Cause:** `$GOPATH/bin` or Go's bin directory is not in your system PATH.

**Resolution:**
- Confirm installation directory:

  ```bash
  go env GOPATH
  ```

- Add `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` (common default) to your shell PATH.

  For bash/zsh, add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

- Reload your shell or restart the terminal.

- Verify:

  ```bash
  gorm version
  ```

  Should print version info.


### Problem: Network Issues or Proxy Errors During Installation

**Symptom:** Errors such as "cannot find module" or connection timeouts.

**Cause:** Network restrictions or Go proxy misconfiguration.

**Resolution:**
- Set Go proxy explicitly:

  ```bash
  go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
  ```

- Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

- For restricted environments, use VPN or internal proxies as needed.


## 2. Configuration Problems

### Problem: Code generation outputs no files or empty directories

**Symptom:** After running `gorm gen -i ./models -o ./generated`, no generated `.go` files appear.

**Cause:**
- Missing or misnamed input files/directories
- Interface or struct filtering excluding all items

**Resolution:**
- Confirm the input path points to your directory or Go interface files containing raw SQL comments.
- Ensure the input directory actually contains interfaces or structs for generation.
- Review any `genconfig.Config` files; filters such as `IncludeInterfaces` or `ExcludeStructs` can exclude all targets. Disable or adjust these filters.
- Use verbose output or check CLI logs for filtering info.

### Problem: `input` flag is missing or invalid

**Symptom:** Running `gorm gen` without `-i` or with an invalid path errors out or refuses to run.

**Cause:** The CLI requires `-i` to specify the input interface file or directory.

**Resolution:**
- Always specify the input path:

  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
  ```

- Make sure the path exists and contains Go source files with annotated interfaces.


## 3. First Generation and Runtime Errors

### Problem: Error messages like "error processing <file>: ..." or "error render template got error"

**Symptom:** The generator fails during processing or template rendering phase.

**Cause:**
- Syntax errors in annotated interfaces or invalid SQL templates
- Mismatched method signatures or absent return types

**Resolution:**
- Validate your interface syntax against the GORM CLI requirements. Every interface method with SQL template must declare return types ending with `error`. For example:

  ```go
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
  ```

- Review your SQL template comments for correct DSL usage â€” missing closing `{{end}}` or malformed placeholders cause parsing errors.
- Remove or correct unsupported methods from interfaces.

- Refer to the [SQL Template DSL guide](guides/core-usage-patterns/template-based-queries) for syntax rules.


### Problem: Generated code does not compile or produces runtime panics

**Symptom:** Compilation errors or panics when using generated APIs.

**Cause:**
- Generated code out of sync with current models/interfaces
- Go module or dependency issues

**Resolution:**
- Regenerate code after every model/interface update.
- Ensure your Go module dependencies are tidy:

  ```bash
  go mod tidy
  go mod verify
  ```

- Check your import paths and Go versions.
- Run tests on example projects (e.g., `examples/`) to confirm your environment is correct.


## 4. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Enable Debug Logs:** Set environment variable to get detailed logs.

  ```bash
  DEBUG=true gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
  ```

- **Run Tests:** Use provided test scripts to validate setup.

  ```bash
  ./scripts/test_all.sh
  ```

- **Simplify Input:** Start from a minimal interface with a single method and expand gradually.

- **Verify Interface and Struct Matching:** Interfaces should be in the same package or directory as related structs for smooth generation.

- **Check Config Files:** If `genconfig.Config` files exist, review filters thoroughly to avoid accidentally excluding everything.

- **Consult Logs:** When the generator prints:

  ```text
  Generating file <output-path> from <input-path>...
  ```

  confirm expected files are created and content is not empty.


## 5. Getting Further Help

- Refer to the [Installation & Quick Start](getting-started/onboarding-core/installing-gorm-cli) guide if installation errors persist.
- Review the [Basic Configuration](getting-started/onboarding-core/basic-configuration) page for details on `genconfig.Config` nuances.
- For first usage, check [Your First Code Generation](getting-started/onboarding-core/first-code-generation).
- Join the GORM GitHub discussions or issues for community assistance.
