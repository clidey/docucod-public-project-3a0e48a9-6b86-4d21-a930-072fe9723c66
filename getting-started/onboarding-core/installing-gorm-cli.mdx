# Installing GORM CLI

This page provides you with a clear, practical guide to installing the GORM CLI tool using Go's tooling. You'll learn the exact command to install the CLI, platform-specific considerations, how to update the tool, verify the installation, and troubleshoot common issues. By following these steps, you'll be ready to generate type-safe query APIs and model helpers quickly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version**: Go 1.18 or later (to support generics).
- **Go environment setup**: Your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` should be configured correctly.
- **Network Access**: Ability to download modules from the internet.

If you haven't installed Go yet, download and install it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

<Tip>
GORM CLI installation relies on Go's `go install` command, which fetches and compiles the latest CLI binary from the repository.
</Tip>

## 2. Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### 2.1 Installation Command

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the latest version of GORM CLI:

```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads the GORM CLI source, compiles it, and places the executable binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` (or default Go bin directory).

### 2.2 Platform-Specific Notes

- **Linux/macOS**
  - Ensure your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your `PATH`.
  - You can add it to your shell profile, e.g., `export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"`.

- **Windows**
  - The binary will be in `%GOPATH%\bin`.
  - Make sure `%GOPATH%\bin` is added to your system PATH environment variable for command-line access.

### 2.3 Verify the Installation

After installation, confirm `gorm` CLI is accessible by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see command usage instructions summarizing available commands, including `gen` for code generation.

<Check>
If you receive a "command not found" error, verify that your Go bin directory is correctly added to your system's PATH.
</Check>

### 2.4 Updating GORM CLI

To update to the latest version at any time, run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This will replace the existing binary with the latest release.

## 3. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

Here are common pitfalls and how to address them:

### Problem: `gorm` command not found after installation

- Make sure your Go bin directory is included in your system `PATH` environment variable.
- You can find this directory with:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

- After confirming the path, add the subdirectory `/bin` to your `PATH`.

### Problem: Go version is older than 1.18

- GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher. Update your Go installation to meet this requirement.

### Problem: Proxy or network issues while downloading packages

- Configure your Go environment to use a Go proxy or disable it if it blocks access:

```bash
# Set Go proxy (recommended)
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct

# Or disable the GOPROXY
export GOPROXY=direct
```

### Problem: Permissions error during installation

- Ensure your user account has write permission to your Go bin directory.
- Alternatively, run the install command with elevated privileges or switch the Go bin path to a writable location.

<Warning>
If you frequently face installation or path issues, it might help to verify your Go environment with `go env` and adjust accordingly.
</Warning>

## 4. Next Steps After Installation

With GORM CLI installed and verified, proceed to:

- Configure your project as described in the [Basic Configuration](/getting-started/onboarding-core/basic-configuration) guide.
- Generate your first query APIs using the CLI with the [Your First Code Generation](/getting-started/onboarding-core/first-code-generation) instructions.
- Explore usage of generated APIs with the [Using Generated APIs](/getting-started/onboarding-core/using-generated-apis) page.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues post-installation, check [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/onboarding-core/troubleshooting-setup) for additional guidance.
</Tip>

### Example Installation Session

```bash
# Install GORM CLI
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Confirm path setup
echo $PATH

# Verify CLI is installed
gorm --help
```

Successful output should begin with usage instructions:

```text
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from Go interfaces with SQL templates
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
