# Validate the Output

This guide walks you through verifying the correctness, completeness, and structure of the code generated by the GORM CLI tool. After running the code generation step, it is critical to confirm that the generated files reflect your input model and interface definitions accurately, contain no syntax errors, and adhere to your configuration settings.

## 1. Understanding What Gets Generated

When you run `gorm gen`, two major categories of output files are created:

- **Query API Implementations**: Go files generating type-safe query methods from your annotated interfaces.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: Helper structs and methods generated from your model definitions to facilitate filters, updates, and association operations.

The output directory structure mirrors your input source files, preserving subdirectories and package layouts.

### What to Look For

- Files with names like `iface.go` typically contain generated query APIs.
- Files like `models.go` contain model-driven field helpers.
- Nested directories output their own generated files respecting any local configuration.


## 2. Confirming Generation Success

After generation completes:

### Step-by-Step Checks

1. **Locate the Generated Files**

   Navigate to the output folder specified by the `-o` flag when running the `gorm gen` command. You should see your files and subdirectories containing `.go` files corresponding to your source packages.

2. **Verify File Content**

   Open key files such as `iface.go` and `models.go` in your output directory. Confirm:

   - Expected interfaces appear as generated methods (e.g., functions like `func QueryUser[T]...`).
   - Models have their field helpers generated, with expected field names and types.

3. **Check Console Messages**

   The generator outputs logs like:

   ```
   Generating file ./generated/iface.go from ./examples/query.go...
   Generating file ./generated/models.go from ./examples/models/user.go...
   ```

   These confirm which source files produced which output.

4. **Run `go fmt` / `goimports`**

   The generator runs code formatters automatically, but you may want to run `go fmt ./generated/...` to verify formatting.

5. **Parse and Compile the Generated Code**

   Try compiling your project or running tests against generated code to catch any syntax or type errors early.


## 3. Detecting and Diagnosing Generation Issues

If expected files or code are missing, or you see errors after generation:

### Common Pitfalls

- **Incorrect Input Path**: Ensure the `-i` flag points to the directory or file containing your annotated Go interfaces and models.

- **Configuration Filters**: Package-level `genconfig.Config` can restrict generation by including or excluding interfaces and structs. Review your configs to ensure your targets are not excluded.

- **No Methods or Structs Found**: Confirm your interfaces have properly annotated SQL template comments and struct fields are exported.

- **Parsing or Syntax Errors**: Improper Go syntax or comments in source files prevent generation. Run `go vet` and `go build` on source packages first.


### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Check Output Logs:** The generator logs skipped files and paths.
- **Validate `genconfig.Config:`** Look for filters like `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, and `ExcludeStructs` which affect output.
- **Source File Structure:** Generated files maintain relative paths to the input directory. Confirm your directory structure.
- **Use Tests:** Run provided tests in the project source to verify generation correctness.


## 4. Sample Verification Workflow

Assuming you generated code with:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Follow these steps:

### 4.1. Confirm Key Files Exist

```bash
ls ./generated
# Expected output files:
# iface.go
# models.go
```

### 4.2. Validate Interface Generation

Open `iface.go`. Search for generated functions, e.g.: 

```go
func QueryUser[T any](db *gorm.DB, opts ...clause.Expression) QueryUserInterface[T] {
    // ...
}
```

### 4.3. Confirm Struct Helpers

Open `models.go`. Look for helper variables matching your structs:

```go
var User = struct {
    ID field.Number[uint]
    Name field.String
    // ...
}{}
```

### 4.4. Build and Test

Run:

```bash
go build ./generated
```

Any syntax or type errors indicate problems to fix in source or generative configs.


## 5. Next Steps After Validation

- **Use the Generated Code**: If generation is successful, proceed to integrating generated APIs into your project.
- **Customization**: Adjust `genconfig.Config` files to refine generation scope or type mappings.
- **Troubleshoot if Needed**: Consult [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../config-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) if errors are present.
- **Explore Usage**: Review [Using the Generated APIs](../first-gen-workflow/using-generated-apis) to learn how to leverage generated code.

## 9. Example Command Recap

```bash
# Generates code from interfaces and models in ./examples to ./generated
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Expected output snippet
Generating file ./generated/iface.go from ./examples/query.go...
Generating file ./generated/models.go from ./examples/models/user.go...
```

After this, verify that your `./generated` directory contains these files, open them to confirm content, and try building your project.

By performing these validations, you ensure your generated code reliably reflects your defined models and queries. This verification step is essential before integrating the generated output into your development workflow.
