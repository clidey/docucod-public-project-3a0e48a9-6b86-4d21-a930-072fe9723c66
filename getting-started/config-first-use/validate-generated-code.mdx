# Validate & Use Your Generated APIs

This guide walks you through simple, practical steps to validate your generated GORM CLI code and start using your first type-safe queries and updates in Go. After generating code, these instructions help you build your project to ensure correctness and show you how to invoke typical operations using the generated APIs.

---

## 1. Build Your Project to Validate Generated Code

Before integrating generated files into your application, ensure the generated code compiles successfully.

### Step-by-Step Build Verification

1. **Change directory to your output folder** (where you generated the code):

```bash
cd ./generated
```

2. **Run the Go build command:**

```bash
go build ./...
```

3. **Observe the output:**

- Successful build confirms the generated code is syntactically valid and aligns with your input interfaces and models.
- Any errors indicate issues in generation or incompatibilities you must resolve before proceeding.

<Tip>
Keep your generated code version consistent with your models and interfaces. Always rerun the generator when those change.
</Tip>

## 2. Use the Generated Query API for Your First Operation

Once your code builds successfully, you can start leveraging the generated type-safe APIs.

### Basic Query Examples

Assuming your generated package is `generated`, and you have a `User` model:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"gorm.io/gorm"

	"generated" // replace with your generated package path
)

func main() {
	// Initialize your GORM DB normally...
	var db *gorm.DB

	ctx := context.Background()

	// Query by primary key using generated Query interface
	user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error fetching user: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("User: %+v\n", user)

	// Query with filters using the generated field helpers
	users, err := generated.Query[User](db).
		Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
		Find(ctx)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error fetching users: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Adult users: %+v\n", users)
}
```

### Step Outline

1. Import the generated package (adjust import path to your output directory).
2. Use `generated.Query[Model](db)` to get an instance of the query interface.
3. Call generated methods like `GetByID` with required parameters and context.
4. Use fluent methods with field helpers (`generated.User.Age.Gt(18)`) for filtering.
5. Handle errors and use the returned data.

<Tip>
If your interface method does not explicitly accept `context.Context`, the generator automatically injects it as the first parameter.
</Tip>

## 3. Using Generated Field Helpers for Updates

The generated code provides field helpers to build updates fluently and type-safely.

Example: Updating a userâ€™s name and age

```go
err := gorm.G[User](db).
	Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(123)).
	Set(
		generated.User.Name.Set("new_name"),
		generated.User.Age.Set(30),
	).Update(ctx)

if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Failed to update user: %v\n", err)
}
```

### Key Points

- Use the `Set()` method with generated field helpers to prepare update assignments.
- Chain with `.Where()` to specify filter conditions.
- Call `.Update(ctx)` to execute the update operation.

## 4. Common Verification and Troubleshooting Tips

- **Build fails?**
  - Confirm you generated code after changing your interfaces/models.
  - Check that your Go toolchain version is >=1.18 supporting generics.

- **Method or struct missing?**
  - Verify your `genconfig.Config` filters (`IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, etc.) to ensure your targets are included.

- **Runtime errors or panics?**
  - Make sure you pass a valid `*gorm.DB` instance with a proper database connection.
  - Confirm your context is non-nil in calls.

<Tip>
Use small, incremental changes and rebuild frequently to quickly catch generation or usage issues.
</Tip>

## 5. Next Steps

- Explore using association helpers for creating, updating, unlinking, or deleting related models.
- Customize generation with `genconfig.Config` to include/exclude interfaces and structs.
