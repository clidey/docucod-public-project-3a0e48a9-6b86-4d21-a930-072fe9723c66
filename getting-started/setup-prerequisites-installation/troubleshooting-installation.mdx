# Troubleshooting Installation

Common installation pitfalls and their solutions—covering issues from the Go toolchain setup, `$PATH` environment configuration, to file permissions. This guide equips you to quickly identify and fix installation problems, so you can confidently move forward with using GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Common Installation Issues & Solutions

### 1.1 Go Toolchain Not Found or Version Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Running `gorm` or `gorm gen` commands results in "command not found" or errors related to Go version.
- The CLI complains about Go version less than 1.18.

**Cause:**
- Go 1.18 or higher must be installed and available in your shell environment.

**Fix:**
1. Verify Go is installed by running:
```bash
go version
```
You should see output similar to `go version go1.18 ...` or higher.

2. If Go is not installed or version < 1.18, install or upgrade Go:
- Visit https://go.dev/dl/ and download the latest stable release.
- Follow platform-specific installation instructions.

3. Ensure your shell recognizes the `go` command by checking that your GOPATH and GOROOT are correctly set and that the Go binary directory is in your `$PATH`.


### 1.2 `gorm` Command Not Found After Installing

**Symptoms:**
- After running `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`, the `gorm` command is not found.

**Cause:**
- Go installs binaries into the Go bin directory which may not be included in your shell’s `$PATH` environment variable.

**Fix:**
1. Identify your Go bin directory:
   - Typically, it's `$GOPATH/bin`.
   - If GOPATH is unset, default is `~/go/bin`.

2. Add the bin directory to your `$PATH`.

For example, in bash or zsh:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

3. Reload your shell session or source your profile:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

4. Verify `gorm` command is now available:
```bash
gorm --help
```


### 1.3 Permission Denied When Executing `gorm`

**Symptoms:**
- Running `gorm` outputs permission denied or similar errors.

**Cause:**
- The binary file installed does not have executable permissions.

**Fix:**
1. Locate the `gorm` binary:
```bash
which gorm
```

2. Change permissions to executable:
```bash
chmod +x $(which gorm)
```

3. Retry running the command.


### 1.4 Errors During Code Generation (e.g., `gorm gen`)

**Symptoms:**
- Errors referencing files or input path issues during `gorm gen -i <input>`.

**Cause:**
- Incorrect or missing input path to Go interfaces file or directory.
- File permissions or file not found.

**Fix:**
1. Verify the input path points to a valid Go file or directory containing interfaces with SQL templates.

2. Check that you have read permission on the specified files/directories.

3. Example command usage:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

4. Double-check the input files contain interfaces annotated with SQL templates for generation.


## 2. Best Practices for Smooth Installation

- Always install Go 1.18 or newer before installing GORM CLI.
- After `go install`, update your `$PATH` to include Go's bin directory.
- Use absolute paths when specifying inputs and outputs to avoid path confusion.
- Run `gorm --help` to confirm CLI installation success.
- Run tests in your project (`go test`) to confirm integration.


## 3. Verification and Testing After Installation

Follow these steps to verify your installation and ensure it works:

1. Check Go version:
```bash
go version
```

2. Check GORM CLI installation:
```bash
gorm --help
```

3. Run a simple generate command on an example directory:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

4. Confirm generated files are created in `./generated` (or your specified output directory).

5. Test your generated code by running:
```bash
go test ./...
```
This ensures your environment and generated code integrate correctly.
