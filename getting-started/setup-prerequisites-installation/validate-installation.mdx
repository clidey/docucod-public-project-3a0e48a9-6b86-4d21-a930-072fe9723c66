# Verifying the Installation

Quickly confirm that your GORM CLI installation is set up correctly by running a simple test command. This validation ensures your environment is ready to generate type-safe query APIs and model helpers before you dive into your first project.

---

## 1. Verify Go Installation

Before checking GORM CLI, confirm that your Go environment is correctly installed and updated to version 1.18 or higher.

```bash
go version
```

Expect output similar to:

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, upgrade it now to ensure compatibility.

<Note>
GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in Go 1.18. Skipping this check will cause CLI failures.
</Note>

## 2. Confirm GORM CLI Installation

Assuming you followed the installation instructions ([Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/cli-installation)), make sure the CLI binary is accessible in your system PATH.

Run:

```bash
gorm -h
```

You should see usage information, including available commands such as `gen` for code generation.

If you receive "command not found", ensure you have installed GORM CLI with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

and that your Go bin directory is added to your PATH.

## 3. Run a Basic Test Command

Use the CLI's `gen` command to perform a dry run that verifies executable readiness.

In your project directory containing Go interfaces (or a sample one), run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

This command:
- Uses the input directory (e.g., `./examples`) containing interface and model definitions
- Generates code into the output directory (e.g., `./generated`)

If this completes without errors, GORM CLI is working correctly.

<Check>
If you donâ€™t have sample interfaces yet, see the [Writing Your First Query Interface and Model](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/writing-query-interfaces-and-models) page for quick examples.
</Check>

## 4. Check Generated Output

After running the generation, inspect the output folder (`./generated` or your configured out path):

- Look for generated `.go` files corresponding to your inputs
- Verify that files contain interfaces like `<YourInterfaceName>Interface[T]` and structs with fields as helpers

Example snippet from generated code:

```go
// Code generated by 'gorm.io/cli/gorm'. DO NOT EDIT.

package generated

import (
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
	// ...
)

var User = struct {
	ID   field.Number[uint]
	Name field.String
	Age  field.Number[int]
}{
	ID:   field.Number[uint]{}.WithColumn("id"),
	Name: field.String{}.WithColumn("name"),
	Age:  field.Number[int]{}.WithColumn("age"),
}
```

Successful generation confirms that your environment supports both parsing code and formatting the output.

## 5. Common Issues and Fixes

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Verification Issues">
<Accordion title="Go version not compatible">
Ensure your Go installation is 1.18 or above:

```bash
go version
```

If older, download the latest stable release from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM CLI command not found">
Run:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Add your Go bin directory (typically `$HOME/go/bin`) to your PATH, e.g.,

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Restart your terminal or source your profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generation errors related to input path or Go code">
Verify your input path points to valid Go source files with interface method comments.

Use the [Writing Your First Query Interface and Model](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/writing-query-interfaces-and-models) guide to create valid input examples.

Make sure files are syntactically correct and include the necessary imports.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output directory is not writable or not created">
Check permissions of the output directory.

You can specify a different output path with the `-o` flag, e.g.,

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./mygenerated
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Once your installation and basic verification succeed:

- Begin [Writing Your First Query Interface and Model](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/writing-query-interfaces-and-models)
- Proceed to [Generating Code](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/generating-code) for your interfaces
- Explore [Using Generated APIs](/getting-started/first-use-configuration/using-generated-apis) to perform your first database queries with type safety

## Summary

This page guided you through confirming your GORM CLI installation by verifying the Go environment, running the CLI help command, executing a code generation test, and inspecting outputs. It highlights typical problems that can occur during validation and points you to the next core onboarding tasks.

<Tip>
Always validate your environment before deep integration to catch issues early and maintain smooth development flow.
