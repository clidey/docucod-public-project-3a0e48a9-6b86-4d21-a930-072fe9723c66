# Installing GORM CLI

Follow these step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool on your system using standard Go tooling. This guide covers multiple platforms and provides best practices to ensure a smooth installation.

## 1. Prerequisites & Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following:

- **Go Version:** You must have Go 1.18 or higher installed, as GORM CLI depends on Go's generics introduced in this version.
- **Supported Platforms:** GORM CLI is cross-platform and works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, as long as the Go environment is properly configured.
- **Network Access:** Required to download the GORM CLI package from the public Go module proxy or direct GitHub repository.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have permissions to install binaries into your Go bin directory (default is `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

<Check>
Verify your Go installation version by running:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output should indicate version 1.18 or above.
</Check>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

You can install GORM CLI easily with the `go install` command, which downloads and builds the latest release directly from its module path.

### Installation Command

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### What This Does

- Fetches the latest GORM CLI source code from its module repository.
- Compiles the CLI executable for your platform.
- Places the executable in your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` by default).

### Add Go Bin to PATH

If the Go bin directory is not in your system `PATH`, you won't be able to run `gorm` globally.

Add it to your `PATH` as follows:

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
```

<Note>
If you installed Go in a non-default location or use modules outside standard GOPATH, adjust the path accordingly.
</Note>

### Verification

After installation, verify that the `gorm` command is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```
You should see the CLI usage information confirming successful installation.

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows:** Ensure your Windows terminal supports Go executables in the bin directory and you have permissions to write there.
- **Linux/macOS:** Use `chmod +x` if necessary on the installed binary, though `go install` typically sets executable permissions properly.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="GORM command not found after installation">
- Confirm the Go bin directory is in your system `PATH`.
- Run `echo $(go env GOPATH)/bin` and see if it's included in your path.
- Restart your terminal or source your profile after updating `PATH`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go version is outdated or incompatible">
- Run `go version` and ensure it returns 1.18 or higher.
- Upgrade Go from https://golang.org/dl/ if necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied when installing">
- Check if you have write permissions on the Go bin directory.
- You may need to run as administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` carefully (not typical for go install).
- Better: fix permissions on your Go workspace instead of using elevated privileges.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network or proxy issues during install">
- Ensure your network allows access to the Go module proxy or GitHub.
- If behind a proxy, configure Go proxy environment variables.
- Try `go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct` to reset proxy settings.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Best Practices

- Always install the CLI with the `@latest` version specifier to get the newest stable release.
- Keep your Go tools updated regularly to avoid compatibility problems.
- Use modules in your projects for smoother dependency management.
- Verify installation by running `gorm --help` before proceeding to generate code or other workflow steps.

## 6. Next Steps

With GORM CLI installed, proceed to:

- Write your first query interfaces and models  
  See: [Writing Your First Query Interface and Model](../first-use-configuration/writing-query-interfaces-and-models)

- Generate code using the CLI  
  See: [Generating Code](../first-use-configuration/generating-code)

- Validate your installation and explore advanced options  
  See: [Verifying the Installation](../setup-prerequisites-installation/validate-installation)
