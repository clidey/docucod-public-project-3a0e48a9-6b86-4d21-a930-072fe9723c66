# Prerequisites

Before you begin using the GORM CLI tool, ensure your development environment meets the minimum requirements. This page helps you verify system compatibility and prevents common setup issues by clarifying the Go version supported, platform compatibility, and other prerequisites necessary to run GORM CLI smoothly.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or newer** to function correctly. This is because it relies heavily on generics introduced in Go 1.18.

- **Check your Go version** by running:

```bash
go version
```

- If the output version is older than 1.18, upgrade Go by downloading the latest version from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

<Tip>
Using a Go version older than 1.18 will cause GORM CLI code generation to fail, as generics support is mandatory.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GORM CLI is compatible with most platforms that support Go 1.18+, including:

- **Linux** (amd64, ARM64)
- **macOS** (amd64, ARM64)
- **Windows** (amd64)

Ensure your platform's Go toolchain is properly installed.

<Note>
GORM CLI does not have platform-specific dependencies but requires a functioning Go environment on supported OS architectures.
</Note>

---

## 3. Environment Setup

To prepare your environment for running GORM CLI:

- **Go workspace setup:** Make sure your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` include the Go binary directory so that installed CLI tools are accessible from your shell.
- **File system permissions:** You should have read/write permissions to the directories containing your Go source code and to the directory where you want to generate code.

---

## 4. Network Requirements

- GORM CLI requires internet access when you run `go install` for initial installation to fetch the CLI from the module proxy.
- During normal generation workflows, no network connection is needed since it runs locally.

---

## 5. Additional Dependencies

- No external software dependencies are needed beyond Go itself.
- The GORM CLI tool imports standard Go and GORM libraries automatically.

<Check>
Make sure your project imports and uses `gorm.io/gorm` and related GORM packages compatible with your GORM CLI version.
</Check>

---

## 6. Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to installation or generating code, verify the following:

- [ ] Go 1.18 or later installed (`go version`)
- [ ] Platform supported (Linux, macOS, Windows amd64)
- [ ] Network access for installing CLI tool (`go install`)
- [ ] Read/write permissions to source and output directories
- [ ] Project uses compatible GORM modules

If these prerequisites are met, you are ready to install and start using the GORM CLI.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Setting Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Go Version Not Supported">
If `go version` shows a version less than 1.18, upgrade your Go installation.

- Download the latest Go from https://golang.org/dl/
- Follow platform-specific installation instructions
- Confirm installation with `go version`
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Not in PATH">
If running `go` commands returns 'command not found', ensure your system PATH includes the Go binary directory.

- On macOS/Linux, add `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin` (or your Go install path) in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
- On Windows, add the Go bin directory to your system Environment Variables' PATH
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File Permission Denied">
You may lack permissions to read source files or write output files if your user account does not have sufficient privileges.

- Check directory permissions with `ls -l` or Windows Explorer
- Run commands with appropriate user permissions
- Avoid generating code into protected system directories
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

After confirming your environment meets all prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation](./cli-installation) page to install GORM CLI.

Then, follow the [Quickstart & Typical Workflow](https://gorm.io/docs/cli.html) guide to create your first query interfaces and generate type-safe code.
