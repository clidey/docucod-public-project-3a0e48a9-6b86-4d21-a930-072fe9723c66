# Prerequisites

Before you begin using GORM CLI, ensure your development environment aligns with the product's foundational requirements. This page guides you through the necessary platform support, Go version, basic project structure, and how GORM CLI integrates with GORM itself.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI requires Go **version 1.18 or higher** because it leverages Go generics extensively. This version constraint is essential for the code generator to produce type-safe query APIs and model field helpers.

### How to Check Your Go Version

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ go version
```

**Expected output example:**

```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your version is below 1.18, please upgrade Go before proceeding.

---

## 2. Understanding Your Project Structure

GORM CLI expects your codebase to organize Go interfaces and Go structs that define queries and models, respectively, in standard Go packages and directories.

- **Interfaces** are your query definitions. They include raw SQL annotations in method comments.
- **Structs** represent database models, including fields and associations.

The CLI analyzes these code components recursively through your project directories, applying any generation configuration (e.g., whitelist/blacklist filters) declared via `genconfig.Config`.

### Basic Structure Example

```plaintext
my-project/
  ├── models/
  │     └── user.go        # Model structs (e.g. User)
  ├── queries/
  │     └── user_queries.go # Raw SQL interface definitions
  ├── generated/           # Output directory (default or configured)
  └── go.mod
```

Your interfaces and models can be in the same or adjacent packages. The generator picks them up using file input paths you provide.

---

## 3. Integration with GORM

GORM CLI is designed as a complementary tool to the widely used [`gorm.io/gorm`](https://gorm.io) ORM library. It generates type-safe APIs and helpers that are **fully compatible** with GORM’s `DB` instances and operations.

**Key points:**

- The generated code works with your existing GORM DB connections.
- Your models should use GORM tags and conventions for compatibility.
- The CLI-generated helpers enable fluent, compile‑time-safe query building and association management.

### Example GORM Usage with Generated Code

```go
// db is your initialized *gorm.DB
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
	Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
	Find(ctx)
```

This example shows how GORM CLI-generated query interfaces and field helpers integrate smoothly with standard GORM workflows.

---

## 4. Platform & Environment Support

GORM CLI supports the following platforms for development:

- Any OS that supports Go 1.18 or newer (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Go modules must be enabled (`GO111MODULE=on` is recommended)

### Network Requirements

- No special network ports are required for GORM CLI itself, as it operates locally.
- Database connectivity depends on your GORM configuration; ensure your DB server is accessible and firewall rules permit connection.

---

## 5. Validating Your Environment

Before running your first code generation, validate that:

1. You have Go 1.18+ installed by running `go version`.
2. Your project layout includes Go files with query interfaces and model structs.
3. Your project uses GORM v1.23+ (or compatible) as a dependency.
4. You can import `gorm.io/cli/gorm` in your code without errors.

### Quick Validation

Try building a minimal example:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/models"
    "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
    var db *gorm.DB // suppose it's properly initialized

    // Fake usage to verify imports
    _ = models.User{}
    fmt.Println("Environment looks good")
}
```

Running `go build` on this snippet without errors confirms your environment supports GORM CLI development.

---

## 6. Optional: Configuration via genconfig.Config

You may customize generation using package-level `genconfig.Config` variables to control file output location, inclusion/exclusion of interfaces or structs, and field mapping for custom helpers.

Example configuration snippet:

```go
package examples

import "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
    ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
}
```

This allows precision control over what code is generated and where it lands.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">

- **Issue:** `go version` reports a version lower than 1.18.
- **Fix:** Upgrade Go by downloading the latest release from https://golang.org/dl/

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Go Modules">

- **Issue:** `go build` fails because modules are disabled.
- **Fix:** Enable modules explicitly by running `export GO111MODULE=on` or running inside a module-enabled directory with a valid `go.mod`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cannot Import gorm.io/cli/gorm">

- **Issue:** Import errors occur for `gorm.io/cli/gorm`.
- **Fix:** Ensure your module dependencies are correct by running `go mod tidy`.
- Also verify your Go proxy or network allows access to the module repository.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Project Structure Not Detected">

- **Issue:** CLI reports no interfaces or models found in input path.
- **Fix:** Make sure your Go files contain interface definitions for queries and structs with exported fields.

</Accordion>

## Next Steps

Once prerequisites are validated and your environment is ready, proceed to the [Installation guide](../installation) to install the GORM CLI tool and explore your first code generation workflow.

You may also refer to the [Integration with GORM](../../concepts/core-architecture/integration-with-gorm) conceptual page to deepen your understanding of smooth workflows.

# Summary

This Prerequisites guide ensures you have the correct Go version (1.18+), a proper project structure with query interfaces and model structs, and that your environment supports integration with GORM for generating type-safe APIs. It highlights how to validate your environment and prepare for the installation and first use of GORM CLI.

# Practical Tips
- Use `go version` frequently to verify your Go environment
- Organize your Go interfaces and structs clearly
- Use `genconfig.Config` to control generation scope early
- Check imports and dependencies with `go mod tidy` before running the CLI
- Validate generated code compiles before integrating further
