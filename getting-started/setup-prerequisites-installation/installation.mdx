# Installation

Get GORM CLI up and running quickly by following these straightforward installation steps. This page guides you through installing the CLI on all supported platforms using Go's package tools, verifying the installation, and updating to the latest version with confidence.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go toolchain**: Go 1.18 or later must be installed and properly configured in your system `$PATH`.
  - Verify your Go version with:

```bash
go version
```

  You should see output similar to `go version go1.18 linux/amd64` or later.

- **OS Compatibility**: GORM CLI supports major platforms:
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows

- **Network Connectivity**: Your environment must allow outbound access to `proxy.golang.org` or other Go module proxies for downloading dependencies.

<Tip>
If you do not yet have Go installed, visit the official Go website at [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl) to download the appropriate version for your system.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Steps

The recommended way to install GORM CLI is via the Go installation toolchain. This ensures you always get the latest stable release.

### 2.1 Install via `go install`

Run the following command to download and build the CLI tool:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This installs the `gorm` binary into your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).
- Ensure this directory is in your system's PATH environment variable so you can run `gorm` from anywhere.

### 2.2 Confirm Installation

Verify the installation completed successfully by checking the version:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output will display the version number, confirming the CLI is ready for use.

If you see an error like "command not found," double-check your PATH or the Go install location.

### 2.3 Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows users:**
  - Ensure your PowerShell or Command Prompt environment has access to the Go binaries directory.
  - You can add this folder to PATH through System Environment Variables.

- **macOS/Linux users:**
  - Confirm `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Add this line to your profile file and reload your shell.

---

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, run the following to verify that the CLI initializes correctly:

```bash
gorm
```

This should display the CLI usage summary with available commands, including `gen` for code generation.

You should see output similar to:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

If an error occurs, verify your installation steps and environment setup.

---

## 4. Updating GORM CLI

Stay up to date with the latest features and fixes by reinstalling the CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Because Go installs the latest version directly, this command upgrades your CLI to the newest release automatically.

After updating, verify again with:

```bash
gorm version
```

## 5. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
- Ensure that your Go binary installation path (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is added to your system PATH.
- Restart your terminal or shell session after modifying PATH.
- Verify the binary exists at the Go bin directory by running `ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin | grep gorm`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Is Below 1.18">
- Upgrade your Go installation from the official Go downloads page.
- The CLI requires Go 1.18+ due to use of generics.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues During Installation">
- Check if your environment uses a proxy blocking access to Go module repositories.
- Configure your Go environment to use a proxy or set `GOPROXY=direct` if needed.
