# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page helps you verify that your environment is ready to run GORM CLI smoothly. By validating system capabilities and dependencies upfront, you avoid common blockers and ensure a seamless setup experience.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

- **Minimum Go Version:** 1.18 or higher
- **Reason:** GORM CLI relies heavily on Go generics introduced in Go 1.18.

**How to check:**

```bash
go version
```
You should see output similar to:

```bash
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, update it to avoid compatibility issues.

<Tip>
Ensure that your `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` are correctly set, and that the `go` command in your terminal points to Go 1.18+.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Operating System Compatibility

GORM CLI supports the primary operating systems where Go development is common:

| OS        | Support Status |
|-----------|---------------|
| Linux     | Fully Supported |
| macOS     | Fully Supported |
| Windows   | Fully Supported |


> GORM CLI is developed and tested across all major OSes, ensuring consistent behavior.

**Additional notes:**
- Ensure your terminal or command line supports Go tooling smoothly.
- Windows users should use PowerShell or Windows Terminal with Go properly configured.

---

## 3. Required Dependencies

Before running GORM CLI, confirm the following prerequisites:

- **Go toolchain:** Installed and accessible on your PATH
- **Network access:** Needed for downloading GORM CLI using `go install`

**Installation command:**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This will place the `gorm` binary in your Go bin directory (usually `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`).

<Tip>
If `gorm` command is not found after install, ensure your Go binary path is added to your system's PATH environment variable.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Optional but Recommended Tools

Though not strictly required, these tools streamline your workflow:

- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or any editor with Go support
- **Version Control:** Git for managing your source code

---

## 5. Validate Your Environment

Run the following quick checks:

```bash
# Check Go version
 go version

# Verify gorm CLI executable
 gorm version
```

Expected output on the `gorm version` command is a printed version string, confirming the CLI is accessible.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues running the `gorm` command, verify permissions and PATH configuration.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go version is too low or not found">

- **Issue:** You see an error related to unsupported Go version.
- **Solution:** Upgrade to Go 1.18 or later.

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -OL https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

- After restart, verify with `go version`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm` command not recognized after installation">

- **Issue:** Your terminal says `gorm: command not found`.
- **Solution:** Add Go bin directory to PATH.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

- Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) to persist.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues when Installing">

- **Issue:** `go install` fails due to network timeout.
- **Solution:** Check your internet connection or configure GOPROXY.

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

</Accordion>
