# Troubleshooting Your First Run

When starting with GORM CLI, encountering issues during your first code generation or build is common. This guide addresses frequent pitfalls and provides clear, actionable steps to resolve them, ensuring that you overcome blockers quickly and confidently.

## 1. Common Problems and Their Symptoms

| Problem                                | Symptom / Error Message                                      | Likely Cause                         |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `gorm gen` command fails             | Error about missing input file or no interfaces found        | Incorrect `-i` path or no query interfaces discovered |
| Generated code fails to build         | Compilation errors referencing generated packages or types   | Mismatched Go version, missing dependencies, or structure errors |
| Code generation outputs partial files| Unexpected incomplete output or silent failures               | Invalid SQL templates or unsupported syntax in interfaces  |
| Generated APIs not accessible or empty| No methods found on generated interfaces                      | Interface methods missing SQL comments or misformatted templates |

## 2. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Your Project Setup and Inputs">
Confirm your `-i` input path points exactly to the directory or Go source file containing your query interfaces annotated with SQL templates.

- Check the directory contains `.go` files with interfaces following the expected pattern.
- Ensure your models and interfaces are in the same package or properly referenced.
- Use the example interfaces from the documentation as a template to verify your syntax.

<Tip>
Run `ls` or `dir` in your input path to confirm file presence.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Check Go Version and Environment">
- GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** for generics support.
- Run `go version` to verify your Go version.
- Ensure your `GOPATH` and `PATH` include Go binaries.

<Warning>
Using older Go versions leads to incompatible generated code and compilation failures.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Generation Command with Verbose Output">
Use the generation command with input and output flags explicitly:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./path/to/generated
```

Verify that:
- The output folder is created and populated.
- No errors are printed during execution.

If you see errors such as "no interfaces found" or "parsing errors," check your SQL template comments.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Interface Method SQL Templates">
- Each method must have valid SQL comments directly above it. For example:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

- Ensure placeholders (`@@table`, `@param`) are correctly spelled.
- Use isolation blocks like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}` as per the template DSL.

<Mistake>
Incorrect or missing SQL comments cause no code generation for that method.
</Mistake>
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Your Model Structs Are Correct">
- Confirm your model structs are well-formed Go structs with GORM tags if necessary.
- Ensure basic fields are supported types (string, int, bool, time.Time, etc.).
- For associations, confirm they follow GORM conventions.

Incorrect model definitions affect field helper generation and limit functionality.
</Step>

<Step title="Build and Test Generated Code">
- In your Go project, import the generated package.
- Run `go build` or `go test` to confirm compilation.

If build errors occur:
- Check that generated code matches your Go version.
- Review missing imports or dependencies.
- Ensure your imports align with your module path.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Specific Issue Resolution

### 3.1 No Interfaces Found Error

- Confirm the input path supplied to `-i` matches the location where interfaces are defined.
- Check that the interfaces have public method signatures with SQL templates in comments.
- Example mistake: missing `//` comment above method or incorrect formatting.

### 3.2 SQL Template Parsing Errors

- Validate templates for syntax errors or unsupported constructs.
- Use the SQL template DSL exactly as documented.
- Avoid escaping `@` incorrectly; use `\@` if literal `@` is needed.

### 3.3 Generated Code Fails with Go Build Errors

- Update to the latest stable Go version (â‰¥ 1.18).
- Ensure Go modules are enabled and tidy (`go mod tidy`).
- Check for naming conflicts or mismatches in generated code.

### 3.4 Missing or Empty Generated Methods

- Confirm interface methods have annotated SQL templates.
- Make sure `genconfig.Config` does not unintentionally exclude interfaces.
- Review filters like `IncludeInterfaces` and `ExcludeInterfaces`.

### 3.5 Association Helper Issues

- Verify associations in models follow GORM conventions.
- Ensure related types and foreign keys are properly declared.
- Review association operations examples to confirm usage.

## 4. Best Practices to Avoid Troubles

- Always start with a minimal working interface and model, then expand.
- Use the examples provided in the product documentation as a baseline.
- Incrementally add SQL templates and test generation frequently.
- Keep `genconfig.Config` settings explicit and minimal at first.

<Tip>
Regularly commit your working state before generating new code to enable easy rollback.
</Tip>

## 5. Getting More Help

- Revisit the [Project Setup & Structure Guide](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/first-steps-with-gorm-cli/project-setup) for foundational setup.
- Explore [Generating Type-Safe APIs](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/first-steps-with-gorm-cli/generating-code) for sample generation workflows.
- Use the [Using Your First Generated APIs](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/first-steps-with-gorm-cli/basic-usage-validation) guide to validate usage.
- If stuck on specific errors, check the GitHub issues or open a question with your error logs.

<Check>
Review these steps carefully and methodically; the majority of issues stem from small configuration oversights or file path mistakes.
