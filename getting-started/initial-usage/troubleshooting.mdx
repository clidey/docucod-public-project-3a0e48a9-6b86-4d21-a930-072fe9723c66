# Troubleshooting & Common Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for GORM CLI. This page helps you solve frequent setup problems encountered during installation, code generation, or integration phases. By following the clear diagnostic steps and actionable solutions here, you will quickly overcome blockers and ensure a smooth start with GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Not Met

Many setup issues originate from missing or incorrect prerequisites. Verify the following:

- **Go Version:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to its use of generics.

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

  If your version is older, upgrade Go to the latest stable release.

- **Environment Path:** Confirm the CLI binary is installed and reachable in your `PATH`.

  ```bash
  which gorm
  ```

  If not found, re-run the installation step:

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```

- **File Permissions:** Make sure you have read/write permissions on your project directory and output folders.

- **Network Access:** Verify your development environment can access external resources if behind a firewall or proxy.


<Tip>
Always confirm your Go environment is properly configured with `go env` if you encounter unexpected behaviors.
</Tip>

## 2. Generator Command Errors

The GORM CLI `gen` command compiles your interfaces and generates code. Hereâ€™s how to troubleshoot common failures:

### a) Missing or Incorrect Input Path

- Ensure the `--input` (`-i`) flag points to a valid Go source file containing query interfaces annotated with SQL templates.

  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
  ```

- If you see errors like "error processing ... no such file or directory", double-check your relative or absolute path.

### b) Output Directory Issues

- The default output directory is `./g` unless overridden via `--output` (`-o`).
- Confirm you have write access to the output directory or specify a accessible path.

  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
  ```

### c) Interface Parsing Errors

- Syntax errors or unsupported constructs in your interface methods may cause generation to fail.
- Check your Go interfaces for correct formatting and ensure SQL templates are properly placed in method comments.

### d) Common Generator Error Messages

| Error Message                               | Cause                                           | Solution                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `error processing <file>: ...`              | Parsing or file issues                           | Verify file exists and is syntactically correct |
| `error render template got error: ...`     | Template rendering or data issue               | Inspect your interfaces and annotations for correctness |

<Note>
Use the `-v` flag or run with `gorm gen --help` for verbose output on errors.
</Note>

## 3. Troubleshooting Code Integration Failures

After generation, you might encounter issues integrating the generated code with your GORM project.

### a) Import Paths and Package Names

- Confirm the generated package matches your import statements.
- If you changed output paths, update your imports accordingly.

  ```go
  import "yourmodule/generated"
  ```

### b) Missing Generated Files

- Run generation commands again and ensure no errors interrupted output.
- Verify the target output directory contains generated files.

### c) Compilation Errors in Your Project

- Errors referencing missing symbols usually point to incomplete generation or mismatched versions.
- Confirm you use the matching CLI version for the generated code.

### d) Database Connection and Context

- Use proper `*gorm.DB` and `context.Context` when invoking generated APIs.
- Example:

  ```go
  u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
  if err != nil {
      // handle error
  }
  ```

### e) Common Pitfall: Forget to Run Migrations

- Generated helpers depend on correct database schemas.
- Run GORM migrations before queries to avoid runtime errors.

## 4. Diagnostic Workflow

Follow this step-by-step flow to isolate issues quickly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Environment">
Check Go version (`go version`) and confirm CLI binary is installed and accessible.
</Step>
<Step title="Prepare Interface & Models">
Make sure your query interfaces are defined with proper SQL templates and models exist in expected packages.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Code Generation">
Execute `gorm gen` with input and output flags. Check for error messages and fix accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Generated Files">
Validate that the output directory contains generated files and matches your import paths.
</Step>
<Step title="Integrate & Build Project">
Import generated code, wire up DB connections, and build your project. Address compile errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Generated APIs">
Run sample queries using generated interfaces. Confirm no runtime errors and correct results.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Common Error Scenarios & Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Error Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Error: 'flag needs an argument: -i'">
This indicates missing input file path for the `-i` flag.

**Fix:** Always specify the input interface file with full path.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generated code 'package ...' not found or wrong">
Mismatch between your import statements and actual generated package.

**Fix:** Update imports to reflect output directory's package name.

Check generated `go.mod` and source for package declarations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Runtime 'record not found' on valid queries">
Likely your database schema did not migrate or seed data properly.

**Fix:** Run GORM auto migrations and seed sample data before querying.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error on dynamic SQL templates in interfaces">
Incorrect template syntax or missing placeholders.

**Fix:** Refer to the Template DSL syntax for conditionals and placeholders.
Check method comments carefully.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied writing generated files">
Output directory is read-only or not writable.

**Fix:** Adjust directory permissions or specify another output path.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep input interfaces simple:** Start with minimal working examples and expand.
- **Use a consistent directory layout** for your models, queries, and outputs.
- **Incrementally generate code and test** after changes to isolate errors early.
- **Use verbose logging** on generation to catch subtle errors.
- **Check for overlapping excludes/includes** in `genconfig.Config` which might hide interfaces or models unexpectedly.
- **Regularly sync CLI tool versions** with your generated code to avoid compatibility issues.
