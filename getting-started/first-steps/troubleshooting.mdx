# Troubleshooting & Common Issues

This page addresses the frequent setup and generation errors new users may encounter when working with GORM CLI. From Go version conflicts and configuration path issues to missing dependencies, you will find clear steps to diagnose problems and effectively resolve them, enabling a smoother onboarding experience.

---

## 1. Diagnosing Go Version Conflicts

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher to support generics used in the generated code.

### Symptoms
- `go` command reports unsupported syntax or unknown generics.
- Build or generation commands fail with errors mentioning generics or Go version.

### Resolution Steps
1. Verify your Go version:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. If your version is below 1.18, update to the latest version following [official Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

3. After updating, confirm the version again and retry running the generator.

<Tip>
Always ensure your "go" command in your shell path points to the updated Go 1.18+ version to avoid conflicts.
</Tip>

## 2. Handling Configuration Path & Output Directory Issues

### Common Issues
- The generated files do not appear where expected.
- The `-o` (output) flag is ignored or leads to permission errors.
- Relative paths cause confusion about where generated code is placed.

### Quick Checks & Fixes
1. Specify the output directory explicitly when running `gorm gen`:

   ```bash
   gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./generated-code
   ```

2. Ensure you have write permissions for the specified output folder.

3. Relative paths are resolved against where you run the command; try using absolute paths if uncertain.

4. To override output path per package, declare `genconfig.Config` with `OutPath` inside your Go files.

<Tip>
Consistency between input path and output directory maintains your project layout cleanly.
</Tip>

## 3. Missing Dependencies and Required Packages

Ensure all necessary dependencies—including GORM and CLI modules—are installed and available to your Go environment.

### Error Signs
- Errors like "cannot find module" or "package not found" during CLI execution.
- Generated code references missing imports.

### How to Fix
1. Ensure your Go modules are initialized with a `go.mod` file.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

   This fetches missing dependencies.
3. Confirm that `gorm.io/cli/gorm` is resolvable by Go.
4. When updating GORM CLI, re-run `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` to get the latest binaries.

<Note>
Generated code depends on the GORM framework and compatible versions. Version mismatches can cause build failures.
</Note>

## 4. Common Error Messages Explained

### a. "Method X.Y: finish method must return at least one value"
Occurs when your interface method with SQL templating has no return values, but the generator expects at least an error return.

**Fix:** Ensure methods returning SQL execution results have a return signature ending with `error` or `(T, error)`.

### b. "Skipping generated file"
Indicates the generator detected a file as already generated or should be excluded based on config.

**Fix:** Check if you unintentionally included output directories as input paths or verify your `genconfig.Config` exclusions.

### c. "failed to write file ... permission denied"
Your process lacks write access to the specified output directory.

**Fix:** Adjust directory permissions or run the command with sufficient privileges.

## 5. Step-by-Step Diagnostic Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go environment">
Run `go version` and verify Go 1.18+ is installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate input paths">
Confirm your interface files/directories exist and contain proper Go source code.
</Step>
<Step title="Review configuration">
Examine any `genconfig.Config` declarations impacting code generation scope and output.
</Step>
<Step title="Run code generation">
Use `gorm gen -i ./your/interfaces -o ./generated` and watch for errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect output directory">
Ensure generated files are written and check logs for skipped files.
</Step>
<Step title="Build your project">
Compile your project including generated code to identify any issues early.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Always pin your Go version to 1.18 or later in CI and development machines.
- Place your `genconfig.Config` in the same package as your interfaces/models for automatic detection.
- Use shell tab-completion or listing to ensure correct file paths are passed.
- Avoid specifying output directories inside `vendor` or read-only directories.
- Keep generated code in a dedicated folder like `/generated` or `/g` to simplify management.

## 7. How to Get Help

If unexpected errors persist:
- Review GitHub issues at [GORM CLI repo](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/issues).
- Join the GORM community on Slack or Discord for real-time assistance.
- Consult detailed code examples and FAQs in the [Getting Started guide](https://gorm.io/docs/cli.html#getting-started).

| Issue                          | Symptom                                              | Quick Fix                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Go version too low             | Syntax or generics errors                             | Upgrade to Go 1.18+                                                                                 |
| Output directory missing files | Files not generated or in unexpected location        | Specify `-o` explicitly and check relative paths                                                   |
| Missing dependencies          | Can't find packages or errors during generation/build | Run `go mod tidy` and reinstall GORM CLI                                                           |
| Method signature invalid      | Panics with method return value errors                | Ensure methods return `(T, error)` or `error` as required                                          |
| Permission denied             | Write errors creating generated files                 | Adjust directory permissions or try a different output location                                   |
