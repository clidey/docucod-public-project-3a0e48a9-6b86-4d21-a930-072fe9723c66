# Quick Validation & Example Run

Verify your GORM CLI installation and code generation with this minimal test to confirm everything works as expected. This guide shows you how to run a sample query and field setter operation using generated code, and where to find your generated files for inspection.

---

## 1. Confirm Generated Files

After running the code generation command (e.g., `gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated`), locate your generated code files:

- By default, these files will be under the directory you specified with `-o`. If you used the default, check the `./g` folder.
- The generated files include:
  - Field helper variables for each model (e.g., `User` fields with typed predicates)
  - Interface implementations for your query interfaces with SQL templates

<Check>
Make sure files such as `generated_user.go` or similar are present in your output folder.
</Check>

---

## 2. Sample Code for Validation

Use this minimal sample to test your environment by running a query and updating a field:

### Example for Querying by ID

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/models"
	"gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/output/models" // Replace with your generated package path
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("test.db"), &gorm.Config{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Ensure the table and some data exist
	db.AutoMigrate(&models.User{})
	db.Create(&models.User{Name: "Alice", Age: 30, Role: "active"})

	// Use generated Query API to get a user by ID
	user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Queried user: %+v\n", user)

	// Update user's Role using generated field helpers
	rows, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
		Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("Alice")) .
		Set(generated.User.Role.Set("updated-role")).
		Update(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Updated rows count: %d\n", rows)
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple fetch by primary key and an update operation using generated API and field helpers.

---

## 3. Expected Outcome

- The query returns the user with ID `1`.
- The update changes the `Role` field of the user named "Alice" to "updated-role".
- The console logs should display the fetched user and number of affected rows equal to `1`.

<Info>
This validates your generated code is correctly wired and functional with your database backend via GORM.
</Info>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="Generated Files Missing After Running CLI">
Check that your `gorm gen` command included the correct input path (`-i`) and that the input contains properly annotated interfaces and model structs. Also verify you have sufficient permissions to write to the output folder (`-o`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Errors Importing Generated Code">
Ensure your Go module imports the generated package path correctly and that you have run `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Query Returns No Results">
Confirm your test database contains appropriate seed data matching your query criteria. Use GORM directly to verify data presence.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Field Helper Update Does Not Apply Changes">
Check that your `Set(...)` is paired correctly with `Update(ctx)` and that the `Where(...)` predicates target existing rows. Ensure your field helper references match your model field names.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps

- Explore [Basic Configuration Setup](/getting-started/first-steps/basic-configuration) to tune your code generation.
- Proceed to [Generating Your First Code](/getting-started/first-steps/generating-code) for detailed generation commands.
- Learn how to use generated APIs effectively via [Using the Generated APIs](/getting-started/first-steps/using-generated-apis).
- If issues arise, consult [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-faq/troubleshooting).

Keep this validation step for ongoing checks when updating your models or generation configs.
