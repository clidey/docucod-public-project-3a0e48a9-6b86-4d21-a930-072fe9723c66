# Quick Validation

This guide helps you verify that your GORM CLI setup and generated APIs are working correctly. You'll immediately validate the generated code by using it in your application, running basic queries, and troubleshooting common issues encountered on the first run.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting the quick validation, ensure:

- You have successfully generated the GORM CLI code using your query interfaces and model structs.
- Your Go environment is correctly set up with Go 1.18+.
- Your database connection is properly configured in your GORM project.
- You have basic familiarity with GORM and SQL queries.

<Tip>
If you haven't generated code yet, consult the [Generating Code](../first-steps/generating-code) guide to complete that step first.
</Tip>

## 2. Validate Generated Query Interface Usage

This section walks you through using the generated Go API to perform common queries and verify expected behavior.

### Step 1: Import Generated Package and Setup DB

In your Go code, include the generated package and your models. Ensure you've instantiated a `*gorm.DB` connection.

```go
import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "your/project/generated"  // replace with your generated package path
  "your/project/models"     // your model structs
)

func quickValidate(db *gorm.DB) {
  ctx := context.Background()

  // Your queries below
}
```

### Step 2: Run Basic Query Using `GetByID`

Use the generated query interface to fetch a single record by ID.

```go
user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
if err != nil {
  fmt.Printf("Error fetching user by ID: %v\n", err)
  return
}
fmt.Printf("User fetched: %+v\n", user)
```

Expected outcome: You get a populated `User` struct for the ID 1.

### Step 3: Run Filter Query With Basic Conditions

Use generated field helpers to perform a filtered query.

```go
users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18), generated.User.Role.Eq("active")).
  Find(ctx)
if err != nil {
  fmt.Printf("Error fetching filtered users: %v\n", err)
  return
}

fmt.Printf("Users older than 18 and active: %d\n", len(users))
```

Expected outcome: You get a slice of users matching the given criteria.

### Step 4: Run a Query Using a Generated Query Method with Template SQL

Invoke methods auto-generated from the SQL interface templates, for example `FilterByNameAndAge`.

```go
q := generated.Query[models.User](db)
q.FilterByNameAndAge("alice", 25)
users, err := q.Find(ctx)
if err != nil {
  fmt.Printf("Error running FilterByNameAndAge: %v\n", err)
  return
}
fmt.Printf("Users named alice aged 25: %d\n", len(users))
```

## 3. Running Your First Update Operation

Try out the generated update method to modify a user record.

```go
updateErr := generated.Query[models.User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, models.User{Name: "updated_name"}, 1)
if updateErr != nil {
  fmt.Printf("Error updating user: %v\n", updateErr)
  return
}
fmt.Println("User with ID=1 updated successfully")
```

Expected outcome: The database record with `id=1` is updated appropriately.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common First-Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="No Generated Code Found or Empty" >
- Ensure your `-input` path points to the correct Go interface file containing SQL template comments.
- Verify you ran the generation command successfully: `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated`
- Review any generation errors shown during the command.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Runtime Errors: Method Not Found">
- Confirm you imported the generated package correctly.
- Make sure you are calling generated methods exactly as defined in your interfaces.
- Check if your generated file is up to date with your query interface changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database Connection Errors">
- Verify your DB connection string and credentials are correct.
- Check network/firewall settings for database access.
- Ensure your DB schema aligns with your models.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Query Returns No Results"
>
- Double-check your filtering criteria are correct.
- Confirm there is data seeded that matches your conditions.
- Use direct SQL queries in your DB to verify expected rows exist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Enable verbose logging in GORM to see generated SQL at runtime for debugging.
</Tip>

## 5. Validate Output and Next Steps

- **Success Indicators**:
  - Queries complete without errors.
  - Retrieved data matches expectations.
  - Updates apply correctly.

- **Try Next**:
  - Explore more advanced queries using generated field helpers.
  - Generate code for your full model and interface set.
  - Refer to [Using Type-Safe Query APIs](../../guides/core-workflows/using-type-safe-query-apis) for deeper usage.
  - Consult [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../troubleshooting/common-issues) for help.

## Appendix: Example Quick Validation Code Sample

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "your/project/generated"
  "your/project/models"
)

func main() {
  db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("testdb.sqlite"), &gorm.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  ctx := context.Background()

  // Step 1: Validate GetByID
  user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error in GetByID: %v\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Printf("Fetched user: %+v\n", user)

  // Step 2: Filter users
  users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Role.Eq("active"), generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
    Find(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error filtering users: %v\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Printf("Number of active users over 18: %d\n", len(users))

  // Step 3: Run update
  err = generated.Query[models.User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, models.User{Name: "newname"}, 1)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error updating user: %v\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Println("User updated successfully.")
}
```

Replace "your/project/generated" and "your/project/models" with your actual import paths.

This completes your quick validation to confirm your GORM CLI code is running as expected.
