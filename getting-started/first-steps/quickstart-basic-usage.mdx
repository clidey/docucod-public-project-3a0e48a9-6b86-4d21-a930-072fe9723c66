# Quick Start: Your First Code Generation

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with GORM CLI! This guide provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough for defining your data models and query interfaces, running the GORM CLI generator, and using the generated code to execute your first queries. By following these instructions, you'll quickly unlock type-safe, interface-driven query APIs combined with model-driven field helpers, delivering a powerful and fluent API for your GORM projects.

---

## 1. Understanding What You Will Achieve

GORM CLI transforms your Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates and your Go model structs into two complementary codebases:

- **Type-safe Query APIs**: Generated from your annotated interfaces, these APIs let you write expressive, compile-time-checked queries.
- **Model-driven Field Helpers**: Generated from your model structs, these helpers simplify filters, updates, and association management with type safety.

This guide walks you through creating a minimal example based on the official README to get you running quickly.

---

## 2. Prepare Your Models and Query Interfaces

You will start by defining:

- Your **data models** as standard Go structs.
- Your **query interface** with raw SQL annotated in Go interface comments.

### Step 2.1: Define Your Model

Create a file named `user.go` in your project (e.g., inside `examples/models`) and define a simple model like this:

```go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name string
	Age  int
}
```

This model uses GORM's standard `gorm.Model` embedded type and adds two fields.

### Step 2.2: Define Your Query Interface with SQL Templates

In a separate file named `query.go` in the same package or directory, define your query interface, annotating methods with raw SQL in comments using the GORM CLI template DSL. Here is a minimal example:

```go
package examples

import (
	"time"

	"gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/models"
)

type Query[T any] interface {
	// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id AND name = "\@name"
	GetByID(id int) (T, error)

	// where("name=@name AND age=@age")
	FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

This example defines two methods:

- `GetByID` fetches a single record by its id.
- `FilterByNameAndAge` applies a simple filter based on name and age.

Notice the use of `@@table` and `@param` syntax to refer to table names and bind parameters safely.

<Tip>
You can include multiple query methods in your interface to cover different use cases. Annotate each method with raw SQL comments so the generator can produce typed implementations.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Run the GORM CLI Generator

Once your models and interface are ready, you run the CLI generator to create the typed query API and field helpers.

### Step 3.1: Installation (if not done yet)

Make sure GORM CLI is installed globally:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Confirm it's accessible by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

### Step 3.2: Run The Generator

Use the `gorm gen` command pointing to your interface file and specifying an output directory:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

- `-i` specifies the path to the file containing your interface with SQL annotations.
- `-o` specifies the output directory where generated code will be saved.

The CLI will parse your interface and models, then generate the type-safe query code and field helpers.

<Check>
Make sure your interface file is syntactically correct and accessible from your working directory. The generator requires Go generics support (Go 1.18+).
</Check>

<Tip>
Use relative or absolute paths consistently for the input and output flags. The default output is `./g` if you omit `-o`.
</Tip>

## 4. Using the Generated Code

With code generated inside `./generated`, you can now use the typed query APIs in your application.

### Step 4.1: Import and Setup

Import the generated package and GORM in your Go code and initialize your database connection as usual.

### Step 4.2: Query Using Generated APIs

Hereâ€™s how to call the generated `GetByID` method:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/models"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
	"generated" // adjust import path to your generated folder
)

func main() {
	db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("test.db"), &gorm.Config{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	ctx := context.Background()

	// Use the generated Query API for User
	query := generated.Query[models.User](db)

	// Fetch user with ID 123
	user, err := query.GetByID(ctx, 123)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error fetching user:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("User: %+v\n", user)
}
```

### Step 4.3: Using Field Helpers

To filter users by age using generated field helpers:

```go
users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
	Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
	Find(ctx)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error filtering users:", err)
}

fmt.Printf("Users over 18: %+v\n", users)
```

<Tip>
You get fluent, type-safe filters and updates with field helpers like `.Eq()`, `.Gt()`, `.Set()`, and association helpers automatically generated from your models.
</Tip>

## 5. Verify Your Results

Your generated query and helpers provide:

- **Compile-time Type Safety**: Calls are checked by the Go compiler.
- **Intuitive Method Names**: From your interface methods.
- **Safe SQL Placeholders**: Parameter binding reduces SQL injection risks.

### Success Indicators

- No errors during generation.
- Generated code appears in your output directory (`./generated`).
- Your Go application compiles and runs without error.
- Queries return expected results from your database.

### Quick Troubleshooting

If generation or usage fails:

- Confirm interface annotations have correct SQL syntax.
- Check Go version is >= 1.18 to support generics.
- Verify Go modules and import paths.
- Ensure your models and interface are in the correct GOPATH or module context.

See [Troubleshooting Generation & Output](/getting-started/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-generation) for detailed diagnostics.

## 6. Next Steps

- Explore extending your query interface with more methods using SQL templates.
- Customize generation behavior via `genconfig.Config` for field mappings and output paths.
- Learn about association operations through the [Working with Associations guide](/guides/advanced-patterns/working-with-associations).
- Validate generated code using the [Validating the Generated Code](/getting-started/first-steps/validating-generated-code) documentation.
