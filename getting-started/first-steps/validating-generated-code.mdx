# Validating the Generated Code

This guide helps you confirm that your generated GORM CLI code is correctly produced, accessible, and ready for use in your project. It will walk you through verifying file output, understanding what to expect from the generated APIs, and diagnosing common pitfalls such as missing or misplaced files.

---

## 1. Understanding What the Generator Creates

When you run the GORM CLI generator, it produces two key pieces of code:

- **Type-Safe Query APIs**: Concrete implementations of your SQL-annotated interfaces providing safe, fluent query methods.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: Strongly typed helpers based on your model structs for building filter, update, and association expressions.

These files are emitted into your specified output directory, following your package structure.


## 2. Locate and Inspect Generated Files

### Step 1: Identify Your Output Directory

- By default, the generated code is written to `./g` unless overridden by the `--output` (`-o`) flag.
- Check your generation command, e.g.:  
  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
  ```
  Here, `./generated` is the output root.

### Step 2: Verify File Structure

- The generator preserves package directory structure within the output path.
- For example, a package `examples` will produce something like:
  - `generated/examples/query.go`  
  - `generated/examples/models.go`

Navigate to these locations and verify files are present.

### Step 3: Open Generated Code

- Open the files to verify the presence of `func` implementations matching your interfaces.
- Look for the standard header:
  ```go
  // Code generated by 'gorm.io/cli/gorm'. DO NOT EDIT.
  ```
- Confirm that the generated structs and interfaces match your source definitions.


## 3. Using Generated APIs in Your Code

Once confirmed, you can import the generated package in your project and invoke generated query methods. For example:

```go
import "path/to/generated/examples"

// Assuming you generated Query[T] in examples/
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

This confirms integration and readiness.


## 4. Common Issues and How to Fix Them

### Issue: No Generated Files Found

- **Cause**: Output directory may be incorrect or empty if generation failed.
- **Remedy**:
  1. Check your `gen` command has the correct `-o` output path.
  2. Verify the input directory or file (`-i`) points to the correct interfaces.
  3. Review `gorm gen` command output logs for errors.
  4. Ensure your interface source files include valid SQL annotations.


### Issue: Generated Files Missing Expected Interfaces or Methods

- **Cause**: Inclusion/Exclusion filters or incorrect configuration.
- **Remedy**:
  1. Review any `genconfig.Config` files in your packages. They may specify `IncludeInterfaces` or `ExcludeInterfaces` filtering out your interfaces.
  2. Remove or adjust filters to ensure your interfaces and structs are included.


### Issue: Compilation or Import Errors Involving Generated Code

- **Cause**: Output directory not included in your module or wrong import paths.
- **Remedy**:
  1. Confirm that your Go module includes the generated code directory.
  2. Confirm import paths in your project reference the generated package correctly.
  3. Run `go mod tidy` and build to refresh module state.


## 5. Best Practices for Validating Generated Code

- **Run Tests Regularly**: Use your project's test suite to ensure generated code behaves as expected.
- **Use Verbose Command Output**: Run the generator with verbose output or check your build logs to catch warnings/errors early.
- **Version Synchronization**: Ensure your GORM CLI version matches your GORM library version for compatibility.
- **Regenerate on Interface Changes**: Each update to interfaces or model structs requires rerunning the generator.


## 6. Sample Validation Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate Code">
Run the CLI generator with your input and output paths:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Output Files">
Confirm files exist under `./generated/examples` matching your input package.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Generated File Headers">
Open a generated `.go` file and validate it contains the code generation notice and method implementations.
</Step>
<Step title="Try Using Generated Code in Your Application">
Write a small function that imports the generated package and calls a method, e.g., `GetByID`.
</Step>
<Step title="Build and Test">
Run `go build` and your tests to ensure no import or compilation errors occur.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Troubleshooting 

### Tips for Diagnosing Generator Problems

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Empty Output Directory">
Check if the generator ran successfully with no errors. Ensure your interfaces include proper SQL annotations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Methods in Generated Files">
Check your `genconfig.Config` filters. Filters can exclude interfaces or structs unintentionally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting or Duplicate Output Packages">
Make sure multiple generation runs do not overwrite or conflict by using distinct output paths or cleaning old files.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Enable Debugging

Add debug to your CLI commands or manually check the generation process by building locally from source logging more detailed info._


## 8. Summary

Validating your generated GORM CLI code is straightforward by checking your output files, confirming they contain your interfaces and methods as expected, and testing usage in your application code. This ensures you can trust the code generation step and continue development confidently.
