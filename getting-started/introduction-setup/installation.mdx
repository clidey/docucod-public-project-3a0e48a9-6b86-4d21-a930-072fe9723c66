# Installation Instructions for GORM CLI

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool using `go install`. You'll find tailored steps for Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, including important environment variable considerations and troubleshooting tips to help you successfully set up the tool.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version:** Go 1.18 or later (GORM CLI requires generics support)
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Go environment set up:** `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT` set appropriately (usually via default Go installation)
- **Network Access:** Ability to fetch packages from `gorm.io` via `go get` or `go install`

<Check>
Ensure Go is installed and accessible:
```bash
go version
```
Expected output example:
```bash
go version go1.20.3 linux/amd64
```
If you see an error, install or update Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Check>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

### Installation Overview

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module. The recommended installation method is using the `go install` command, which downloads and installs the latest version directly from the repository.

### Installation Command

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command will install the `gorm` CLI binary into your Go binary directory.

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **Linux/macOS:**
  - The binary will be placed in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` by default.
  - Make sure this directory is included in your `$PATH` environment variable to execute `gorm` from anywhere.

- **Windows:**
  - The binary will be placed in `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` by default.
  - Ensure that this path is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Verifying Your PATH

After installation, verify that your Go binary directory is in your PATH:

- **Linux/macOS:**

```bash
echo $PATH
```
Look for `$HOME/go/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin` in the colon-separated list.

- **Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
echo $Env:PATH
```
Look for `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` in the semicolon-separated list.

## 3. Validating the Installation

After installation, verify that the `gorm` CLI is installed and working:

```bash
gorm --version
```

**Expected outcome:**

- The command outputs the installed version or shows the CLI help text.
- No "command not found" or "executable not recognized" errors.

### Example Output

```bash
GORM CLI Tool
Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

If you see output similar to the above, the CLI is correctly installed.

## 4. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### CLI Not Found After Installation

<Tip>
If the terminal returns "command not found" (Linux/macOS) or "'gorm' is not recognized" (Windows):

- Verify that your Go binary directory (e.g., `$HOME/go/bin` or `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`) is in your system's PATH.
- Restart your terminal or command prompt after modifying environment variables.
- On Windows, you may need to restart your system for PATH changes to apply.

To temporarily add the Go bin directory to PATH (Linux/macOS):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Verify with:

```bash
which gorm
```

</Tip>

### Proxy or Network Issues During Install

<Warning>
If the `go install` command fails to download packages:

- Check your internet connection.
- If behind a corporate firewall or proxy, configure Go environment variables `GOPROXY` accordingly.
- Consider running:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

Then try installing again.
</Warning>

### Go Version Mismatch

<Warning>
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer. Use:

```bash
go version
```

If your version is older, update Go.
</Warning>

## 5. Summary & Next Steps

You have now installed GORM CLI and verified it works across your platform.

### What to Do Next

- Explore using `gorm gen` to generate type-safe query APIs and field helpers with your Go code.
- Refer to the [Generating Code]( /getting-started/first-run-generation/generating-code) guide to learn how to write interfaces and generate code.
- Customize your setup with advanced configuration as needed in the [Customizing Code Generation]( /getting-started/configuration-validation/customizing-generation) guide.

### Getting Help

- Check the [Troubleshooting Common Issues]( /getting-started/configuration-validation/troubleshooting) page if you encounter problems.
- Visit the GORM CLI GitHub repository for updates and issues: [https://github.com/go-gorm/cli](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli)

## 6. Additional Tips

<Info>
- Always use the `@latest` tag in the `go install` command to ensure you get the most recent, stable version of the CLI.
- Use versioned installs by replacing `@latest` with a specific version tag for reproducible builds.
- Managing multiple Go versions with tools like `gvm` or `asdf` can help maintain compatibility across projects.
