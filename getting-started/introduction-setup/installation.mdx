# Installing GORM CLI

This guide provides practical, step-by-step instructions to install GORM CLI on your development machine using the standard Go tooling. By following this process, you'll set up GORM CLI globally, enabling seamless generation of type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers in your Go projects.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Review

Before installation, ensure your environment meets these requirements (also see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/introduction-setup/prerequisites-requirements)):

- **Go version:** 1.18 or newer (generics support required)
- **Go environment setup:** Go binary and `GOPATH` properly configured
- **Access:** Permission to install Go binaries globally

<Tip>
Verify your Go installation version by running:

```bash
go version
```

You must see `go version go1.18` or later.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

The recommended installation method uses the Go tool to install the latest GORM CLI binary globally.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the Go install command">
Open your terminal and execute:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads, builds, and installs the `gorm` CLI executable under your Go binary directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin`).

Expected Output:
- Successful completion without errors.
- `gorm` binary available in your Go bin directory.

Tip: If you encounter permissions errors, ensure your Go bin directory is writable or consider using a user-level install.
</Step>

<Step title="Add GORM CLI binary to your PATH">
Make sure that your Go binary directory is in your system's `PATH` environment variable so you can run `gorm` from any location.

For example, add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

After adding this, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Check command availability:

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see GORM CLI version info indicating a successful installation.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If `gorm` is not found:
- Confirm Go bin directory is correct: `go env GOPATH` and append `/bin`
- Verify `PATH` settings are applied (`echo $PATH`)
- Restart your terminal session if necessary
</Warning>

## 3. Platform Considerations

- **Linux/macOS**: The `go install` method works natively.
- **Windows**: Ensure Go is installed and in PATH. The Go bin directory typically resides at `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`.

<Tip>
On Windows PowerShell, add GORM CLI to your path as:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$env:USERPROFILE\go\bin"
```
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying Your Installation

Confirm you have installed the CLI correctly and it responds as expected:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected:

```
GORM CLI Tool
Version: <version_number>
```

Additionally, run the help command:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see usage instructions indicating the CLI is ready.

<Check>
Successful version display and help information confirms the CLI is properly installed and configured.
</Check>

## 5. Your Next Steps

With GORM CLI installed, you're ready to integrate it into your Go projects.

Proceed to:

- [Configuration Setup](/getting-started/introduction-setup/configuration-setup) to customize generation behavior
- [First Code Generation](/getting-started/quickstart-validation/first-code-generation) to generate your initial type-safe query APIs

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Missing">
Ensure that Go 1.18+ is installed by running `go version`.
If an older version is installed, upgrade your Go installation following official instructions: https://golang.org/doc/install.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="`gorm` Command Not Found After Installation">
- Verify `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.
- Check where Go installs binaries with `go env GOPATH` then look inside the `bin` folder.
- Restart your terminal or shell after making PATH changes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Installing CLI">
- Check write permissions on your Go binary directory.
- Use user-local installation or adjust directory permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Proxy or Network Problems During `go install`">
- If behind a corporate proxy or firewall, ensure network access to `gorm.io/cli/gorm` and its dependencies.
- Configure Go proxy settings or use `GOPROXY=direct` as needed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
