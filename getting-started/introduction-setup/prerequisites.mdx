# Prerequisites & System Requirements

To successfully install and start using GORM CLI, your development environment must meet specific software prerequisites and system requirements. This page outlines the necessary Go versions, operating systems, and foundational knowledge you should have before proceeding with installation and setup.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

GORM CLI leverages modern Go features, ensuring compatibility and type safety through recent Go language advancements.

- **Required Go version:** **Go 1.18** or higher.
  - This minimum version is necessary due to the usage of generics in the generated APIs.
  - Ensure your Go environment (`go version`) reflects version 1.18+ prior to installation.

<Tip>
Using an unsupported Go version (below 1.18) will cause build failures or runtime issues. Upgrade your Go toolchain before proceeding.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is designed to be OS-agnostic, with seamless operation on major platforms where Go is supported.

- **Operating Systems Supported:**
  - Linux (recommended distributions supporting Go 1.18+)
  - macOS (modern versions compatible with Go 1.18+)
  - Windows 10 and later

Installation commands and usage on all these systems are consistent, but verify that your OS environment supports Go and required tooling.

---

## 3. Base Knowledge Requirements

Before diving into installation and usage, ensure you have a good understanding of the following concepts and tools to maximize your success:

- **Familiarity with Go:**
  - Basic development and command line experience with Go.
  - Ability to run `go build`, `go test`, and `go mod` commands.

- **Understanding of GORM:**
  - Basic knowledge of GORM models and struct definitions.
  - Experience writing Go structs that represent database tables.
  - Familiarity with interfaces in Go, as GORM CLI generates code based on interface definitions.

- **Database Connection Basics:**
  - Knowledge of connecting a Go application to a database using GORM.
  - Understanding DSNs (Data Source Names) for database connectivity.

<Tip>
If you are new to GORM, we recommend reviewing the official [GORM Documentation](https://gorm.io/docs/) first to get acquainted with model definitions and ORM basics.
</Tip>

## 4. Environment Setup and Tools

Before installing GORM CLI, prepare your environment with essential tools:

- **Go executable:** Confirm Go is installed and properly added to your system's PATH.
- **Code Editor:** Use an IDE or editor with Go support (e.g., VS Code, GoLand) for editing models and interfaces.
- **Database Server:** Although GORM CLI generates code based on models and interfaces, having an accessible database for testing (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) is best practice.

---

## 5. Network and Permissions

GORM CLI primarily operates locally and generates code files; network requirements are minimal but consider these points:

- Access to the internet for downloading Go modules and dependencies.
- Proper file system permissions to create and modify project files and directories.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Using Go versions older than 1.18** will lead to unexpected compile errors.
- **Running without a foundational understanding of GORM models and Go interfaces** may result in confusion when defining your query APIs.
- **Permissions issues:** Ensure your user account has write access to the project directory for generated code.

---

## Summary

By confirming that your Go version is 1.18 or above, running on a supported OS, and possessing a fundamental understanding of GORM models and interfaces, you are well-prepared to install and start using GORM CLI. Preparing your environment this way ensures a smooth installation experience and successful code generation process.
