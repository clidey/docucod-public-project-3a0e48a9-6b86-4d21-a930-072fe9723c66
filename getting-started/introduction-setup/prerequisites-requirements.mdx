# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your development environment to use GORM CLI effectively by ensuring the minimum system specifications, dependencies, and permissions are met. This page details the essential requirements needed before installing and running the CLI for generating type-safe query APIs and field helpers.

---

## 1. System Requirements

GORM CLI is designed to work within an environment suitable for Go development with generics support.

- **Operating System:** Any OS supported by Go 1.18+ (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Go Version:** 1.18 or later (required for Go generics support)
- **Memory:** Minimum 2 GB RAM recommended for smooth code generation
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 100 MB free space for installation and generated code output

> The primary requirement is Go 1.18+ because GORM CLI’s code generation depends heavily on Go generics.

## 2. Dependencies

Before using GORM CLI, verify that the following dependencies are installed:

- **Go 1.18+**: 
  - Install from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
  - Verify installation with:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

- **GORM ORM**: 
  - The CLI integrates seamlessly with GORM (gorm.io/gorm), so projects should include it for runtime use.

- **GORM CLI binary itself:**
  - Install the latest CLI tool via:

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```

- **Optional but Recommended:**
  - `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting generated code; typically included with Go tooling

## 3. Access and Permissions

- **File System Access:** Ensure read access to your Go interface and model files that define query interfaces and structs.
- **Write Permissions:** Ensure your user account can write to the output directory specified during generation.
- **Network Access:** Required if you need to fetch external modules or dependencies (for Go modules).

> Note: GORM CLI does not require network access during code generation if all module dependencies are already vendored or cached locally.

## 4. Development Environment Setup

A typical development flow assumes you have the following setup in your project:

- A Go module (`go.mod`) initialized with your dependencies
- Go source files containing your query interfaces with SQL templates
- GORM model structs defined in your project

Example folder structure:

```plaintext
my-project/
  ├── go.mod
  ├── models/
  │   └── user.go
  ├── queries/
  │   └── user_query.go
  └── generated/
```  

The output directory `generated/` is where your generated code will be placed.

## 5. Version Compatibility

Stay updated with the latest GORM CLI releases to benefit from new features and bug fixes. GORM CLI aligns with:

- Go language with generics support (v1.18+)
- GORM ORM versions compatible with your project

Verify the version of GORM CLI installed:

```bash
gorm gen --version
```

_(If supported by CLI)_

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips Before Installation

- Confirm Go version is 1.18 or above, or the CLI will fail.
- Verify your Go path and GOPATH environment variables are set correctly to avoid installation issues.
- Ensure you have network connectivity if installing the CLI with `go install` for the first time.

## Summary

Meeting these prerequisites guarantees a smooth experience with GORM CLI code generation. Once met, you are ready to proceed to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/introduction-setup/installation) to install the CLI.

<Tip>
Ensuring your system has Go 1.18+ before installation prevents setup failures later on.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Attempting to run GORM CLI with unsupported Go versions will result in errors due to generics reliance.
