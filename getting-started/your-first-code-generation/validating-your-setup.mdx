# Validating Your Setup

Quickly confirm that your GORM CLI code generation succeeded by inspecting the generated files, verifying the output directory structure, and running sample queries against your Go application. This guide provides clear steps to ensure your environment is ready for further development, along with common troubleshooting advice to resolve frequent errors.

---

## 1. Verify the Output Directory

After running the `gorm gen` command, your generated code should appear in the designated output directory.

### Steps

1. **Locate the output directory**

   - By default, the output path is `./g` unless overridden with the `-o` or `--output` flag during code generation.

   ```bash
   gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
   ls ./generated
   ```

2. **Confirm the directory contains generated `.go` files**

   - The generated files correspond to your input packages and include interface implementations and field helpers.

3. **Check directory structure**

   - Confirm that the package subdirectories preserve your source package layout.
   - Confirm that files are not empty and have recent timestamps after generation.

### Tips

- If no files appear, ensure that your interfaces and models are correctly defined and that the input path was correctly specified.
- If you use per-package configuration via `genconfig.Config`, make sure the `OutPath` is set and matches your expectations.

---

## 2. Review the Generated Code Files

Inspect key generated files to ensure they include expected code constructs.

### What to Look For

- **Interface implementations:** Look for generated structs named like `{InterfaceName}Impl` and methods implementing your query interfaces.

- **Field Helpers:** Check for variable declarations that provide type-safe field helpers matching your model structâ€™s fields.

- **Package declarations and imports:** Verify the packages match your project structure.

- **Auto-generated header comments:** Files should start with `// Code generated by 'gorm.io/cli/gorm'. DO NOT EDIT.`

### Example

Open a generated file (e.g. `generated/query.go`) and verify:

```go
// Code generated by 'gorm.io/cli/gorm'. DO NOT EDIT.

package generated

import (
    "gorm.io/gorm"
    // ... other imports
)

type QueryInterface[T any] interface {
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)
    UpdateInfo(user models.User, id int) error
    // ... other methods
}

// ... implementations

var User = struct {
    ID field.Number[uint]
    Name field.String
    // ... other fields
}{
    ID: field.Number[uint]{}.WithColumn("id"),
    Name: field.String{}.WithColumn("name"),
}
```

### Tips

- Use your IDE or `grep` to search for expected method names and struct helpers.
- Empty or minimal files may indicate problems in interface definitions or generator processing.

## 3. Run Sample Queries to Confirm Integration

Executing generated query functions verifies that your generated code compiles and works as expected with the GORM DB.

### Setup a Test Database

You can use SQLite in-memory mode for quick validation:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
    "gorm.io/gorm"
    "context"
    "your_module/generated" // replace with your generated package import path
    "your_module/models"    // replace with your models package
)

func main() {
    db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open(":memory:"), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    err = db.AutoMigrate(&models.User{})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    ctx := context.Background()

    // Insert seed data
    db.Create(&models.User{Name: "alice", Age: 30, IsAdult: true})

    // Run a sample generated query
    u, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Got User: %#v\n", u)
}
```

### Expected Outcome

- The application compiles without errors.
- The `GetByID` method returns the user you seeded.
- The SQL generated by your query is valid for the database dialect.

### Tips

- Set the environment variable `DEBUG=true` if your generated code or tests support logging the SQL queries.
- When you encounter errors, verify that your models and interfaces match the database schema.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues & How to Fix">
<Accordion title="No Generated Files Found">

- **Cause:** Input path does not contain valid interfaces or models.
- **Solution:** Double-check the path supplied to `gorm gen -i` and ensure your Go interfaces have SQL template comments.
- Check that your interfaces and models are exported and correctly annotated.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compile Errors After Generation">
- **Cause:** Generated code references types or imports that are not resolvable.
- **Solution:** Verify that your models and interfaces are in the expected packages and imported in your project.
- Use `go mod tidy` to clean up module dependencies.
- Ensure your generator runs within your module root directory.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Errors Running Generated Query Methods">
- **Cause:** Mismatch between generated code and database schema.
- **Solution:** Ensure your DB schema matches your Go models.
- Run migrations manually if needed.
- Use fully qualified package imports if you have custom types.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Output Directory">
- **Cause:** `genconfig.Config` overriding the output path.
- **Solution:** Check any `genconfig.Config` declarations in your source packages for an overridden `OutPath`.
- Remove or adjust as needed.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Confirming Your Environment is Ready

After completing validation, you should be confident your generated code integrates well with your GORM project.

<Check>
- Output directory contains non-empty, well-formed generated `.go` files.
- Generated files define interfaces, implementations, and field helpers matching your inputs.
- Sample queries compile and run against a test DB returning expected results.
- You understand how to find and fix common generation or runtime issues.
</Check>
