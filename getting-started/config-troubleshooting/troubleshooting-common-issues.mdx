# Troubleshooting Common Issues

When working with GORM CLI, encountering issues during installation, code generation, or runtime is a natural part of the learning process. This guide helps you quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve frequently faced problems so you can get back to productive development with confidence.

---

## 1. Installation Problems

### Issue: `gorm` command not found after `go install`

**Symptoms:**
- Running `gorm` in your terminal yields "command not found" or similar.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm Go binary install path is added to your system `PATH`. By default, Go installs binaries to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.
2. Check your `PATH` environment variable with:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

3. If missing, add the Go bin directory to PATH. For example, on Linux/macOS:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

Add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to make it permanent.

4. Verify installation:

```bash
gorm version
```

Should output the CLI version.

<Tip>
If using Windows or a custom Go install location, ensure the correct binary path is included in your system environment settings.
</Tip>

### Issue: Permission Denied When Installing

**Symptoms:**
- Errors like `permission denied` or `cannot create executable` during `go install`.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Avoid installing into system directories requiring elevated permissions.
2. Ensure you are not running as root or with conflicting permissions.
3. If permission issues persist, try:

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

4. Check and correct permissions on `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

## 2. Code Generation Failures

### Issue: `gorm gen` command fails or generates incomplete code

**Symptoms:**
- Generation process exits with error or does not produce expected output in the specified directory.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm you are running the command from the correct project directory where your model and interface files exist.
2. Validate your query interfaces have properly formatted SQL templates (e.g., comments with SQL statements) as per [Template-Based Queries](../guides/advanced-use-cases/template-based-queries).
3. Check for syntax errors in your Go model and interface files.
4. Verify your `genconfig.Config` settings to ensure inclusion/exclusion filters are not omitting your target files.
5. Run generation with verbose logging to capture errors:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated --verbose
```

6. Inspect generated files for unexpected omissions or syntax errors.

<Tip>
When you encounter errors about missing files or missing generated methods, confirm your interfaces are included in the config or match the generation patterns.
</Tip>

---

### Issue: Generated code references missing types or packages

**Symptoms:**
- Compile errors in generated files due to undefined types or imports.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Confirm that your model structs and any custom types are defined and imported correctly in the source packages.
2. If using custom field helpers (e.g., JSON), ensure their definitions are included and mapped in `genconfig.Config`.
3. Check your Go module dependencies are tidy and updated:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

4. Regenerate code after fixing imports and types.

## 3. Runtime Errors Using Generated APIs

### Issue: Query methods return errors or unexpected results

**Common Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Database connection issues:** Ensure your `*gorm.DB` instance is correctly initialized and connected.
2. **Filter or query parameters invalid:** Validate inputs match expected types and constraints in your interfaces.
3. **Missing context parameter:** Calls to generated APIs automatically include `context.Context`. Make sure you provide it.
4. **SQL template mismatches:** Confirm your interface comments contain valid SQL syntax with proper placeholders.

<Tip>
Use logging or debug SQL by enabling GORM's debug mode to inspect generated queries.

```go
db = db.Debug()
```
</Tip>

---

## 4. Common Model and Interface Setup Pitfalls

### Problem: Generated field helpers do not include expected fields

**Checklist:**
- Make sure fields in your model structs are exported (start with uppercase letter).
- Verify any `gen:"name"` struct tags map fields correctly.
- Check whether `IncludeStructs` or `ExcludeStructs` in your config is filtering out models unintentionally.
- Refresh your configuration and regeneration steps after modifying struct field tags.

### Problem: Interfaces with templated methods missing or incorrect

**Checklist:**
- SQL templates must be defined inside method comments exactly as shown in examples.
- Placeholders must match method parameter names (e.g., `@id`, `@user.Name`).
- Use the DSL directives like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}` correctly for dynamic SQL.
- Validate all interface methods return errors and compatible types.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Logs and Diagnostics

- Use the verbose or debug flags in the CLI to get more details:

```bash
gorm gen --verbose
```

- For runtime, enable GORM debug, or log SQL statements.
- Check Go build logs for hints on missing dependencies.
- Confirm environment variables, e.g., DSN strings, are correct for your database connections.

## 6. Support and Further Help

If issues persist after thorough troubleshooting:

- Review the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/setup-basics/installation).
- Verify your workflow against [Define Models and Query Interfaces](../getting-started/first-gen-workflow/define-models-interfaces) and [Generate Code](../getting-started/first-gen-workflow/generate-code).
- Consult the [Integration Touchpoints](../overview/core-architecture-concepts/integration-touchpoints) for advanced configuration.
- Seek help in official forums, GitHub issues, or community channels.

| Symptom                           | Cause                             | Solution                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `gorm` command not found          | PATH missing Go bin               | Add `$HOME/go/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin` to PATH    |
