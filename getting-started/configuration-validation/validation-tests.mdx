# Validating Your Setup

Ensuring that your GORM CLI installation, generated code, and runtime usage are working correctly is crucial before integrating the tool deeply into your projects. This guide provides a practical checklist and sample commands for verifying each stage â€” from installation validation to running generated APIs with real data models.

---

## 1. Verify GORM CLI Installation

Confirm the `gorm` CLI tool is installed and accessible.

### Check CLI Version

Run the following command to verify installation and see the installed version:

```bash
gorm --version
```

You should see an output similar to:

```
gorm version vX.Y.Z
```

If the command is not found or errors, ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your system's PATH environment.

### Troubleshooting CLI Installation

<Tip>
If `gorm` is not found:
- Verify that you ran `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` with a proper Go 1.18+ environment.
- Check your system PATH environment includes Go binaries.
- On Windows, ensure `%GOPATH%\bin` is in your PATH.
</Tip>

## 2. Validate Your Code Generation Setup

After writing your query interfaces and model structs, run the generator and verify output correctness.

### Run Code Generation

From your project directory containing `examples/query.go` and models, run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./examples/output
```

Expected:
- The command completes without error.
- Generation messages indicate files created under `examples/output`.

### Confirm Generated Files

Check that the output directory contains Go source files such as:

- `query.go` with generated query implementations
- `models.go` or related files with generated field helpers

You can inspect files manually or use quick commands:

```bash
ls examples/output
```

or on Windows:

```powershell
dir examples\output
```

### Example File Content Check

Generated files should include functions and structs matching your interfaces and models. For example, look for the `Query[T any]` interface and its implementation.

---

## 3. Run Generated Code in Tests or Simple Programs

After generation, validate the generated APIs function correctly by writing or running tests.

### Use Provided Test Helpers

The example output includes test helpers and unit tests demonstrating usage against an in-memory SQLite database.

To run tests:

```bash
go test ./examples/output/...
```

This runs tests covering:
- Query interface method implementations
- Field helper predicates
- Association operations

### Sample Test Highlights

- Data is seeded in-memory for isolation.
- Query methods like `GetByID`, `FilterWithColumn`, `UpdateInfo` are exercised.
- Field helpers tested for filtering, updating, creating, and association management.

Sample test command output:

```
ok   	examples/output	0.123s
```

### Minimal Test Invocation Example

You can write a minimal Go test using the generated APIs:

```go
package examples_test

import (
    "context"
    "testing"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/models"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/output"
    "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
    "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func TestBasicQuery(t *testing.T) {
    db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open(":memory:"), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }

    if err := db.AutoMigrate(&models.User{}); err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Seed sample data
    db.Create(&models.User{Name: "alice", Age: 30})

    query := output.Query[models.User](db)

    user, err := query.GetByID(context.Background(), 1)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("GetByID failed: %v", err)
    }
    if user.Name != "alice" {
        t.Errorf("unexpected user name: %s", user.Name)
    }
}
```

Run with:

```bash
go test -v
```

### Troubleshooting Tip
If you encounter issues running tests due to missing dependencies or Go modules, ensure you run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

inside your working directory to clean up and fetch necessary modules.
