# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve typical problems you might encounter when working with GORM CLI. It covers installation hiccups, environment and path issues, code generation errors, and runtime problems, providing actionable fixes so you can get back to productive coding swiftly.

## Common Problems & How to Fix Them

### 1. Missing or Incorrect Go Version

**Symptom:** Running `gorm` or `gorm gen` fails or the binary is not found.

**Cause:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher for generics support.

**Resolution:**

- Verify your Go version:
  ```bash
  go version
  ```
- If the version is below 1.18, upgrade Go:
  - Download the latest [Go release](https://go.dev/dl/).
  - Follow your OS-specific installation instructions.
- After upgrading, reinstall GORM CLI:
  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```
- Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$GOBIN`) is in your PATH:
  ```bash
  echo $PATH
  ```
  Add `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to your shell profile if needed.

---

### 2. GORM CLI Binary Not Found After Installation

**Symptom:** Command `gorm` is not recognized after installation.

**Cause:** The `go install` puts binaries in `$GOPATH/bin`, which may not be in your system PATH.

**Resolution:**

- Confirm binary was installed:
  ```bash
  ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
  ```
- Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your PATH:

  For bash/zsh:
  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  For fish shell:
  ```fish
  set -Ua fish_user_paths (go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

- Restart your terminal and verify by running:
  ```bash
  which gorm
  ```

### 3. Code Generation Errors: Missing Input File or Directory

**Symptom:** When running `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces`, you see errors like:

```
error processing ./path/to/interfaces: open ./path/to/interfaces: no such file or directory
```

**Cause:** The input path is incorrect or does not contain valid Go interface files.

**Resolution:**

- Double-check the path provided to the `-i` flag exists and points to the correct directory or Go file.
- Confirm your Go interface files with SQL templates exist in that location.
- Example command:
  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
  ```
- Use relative or absolute paths carefully.

---

### 4. Empty or No Generated Files

**Symptom:** Generating code produces empty output directory or no files.

**Cause:**
- No matching interfaces or model structs found.
- Filters in `genconfig.Config` exclude all interfaces or structs.

**Resolution:**

- Review your `genconfig.Config` (if any) for `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, and `ExcludeStructs` settings.
- Make sure interfaces you want to generate have names matching inclusion patterns.
- For beginner troubleshooting, try removing or simplifying your config to generate everything initially.
- Confirm your query interfaces have SQL template comments properly documented.

Example minimal config to include all interfaces:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{}, // empty means include all
}
```

---

### 5. SQL Template Parsing Errors in Interfaces

**Symptom:** Error while generating code mentioning malformed SQL template or missing parameter binding.

**Cause:** SQL comments on interface methods have invalid template syntax or misuse of placeholders.

**Resolution:**

- Check your SQL template comments carefully:
  - Use `@@table` for model table names.
  - Use `@param` to bind method parameters.
  - Use `{{where}}`/`{{set}}` blocks correctly.

- Avoid escaping `@` signs unintentionally, which breaks parsing.
- Refer to the [Template DSL documentation](https://gorm.io/cli/#template-dsl) for correct syntax.
- Example correct template in comment:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

---

### 6. Permission Denied When Writing Generated Files

**Symptom:** Error writing files during generation:

```
failed to write file ./generated/file.go: permission denied
```

**Cause:** The output directory is not writable by your user.

**Resolution:**

- Verify output directory permissions.
- Change ownership or permission:
  ```bash
  chmod -R u+w ./generated
  ```
- Run generation command from a terminal with proper permissions.

---

### 7. Generated Code Fails to Compile

**Symptom:** Errors in generated files when building your Go project.

**Cause:**
- Go version mismatch.
- Missing dependencies such as GORM.
- Configuration inconsistencies.

**Resolution:**

- Confirm Go version >= 1.18.
- Ensure your module requires GORM and related packages:
  ```bash
  go get -u gorm.io/gorm
  go get -u gorm.io/cli/gorm
  ```
- Import generated packages properly in your application.
- Check generated code for import errors or missing packages.
- Run `go mod tidy` to clean dependencies.

---

### 8. Problems with Custom Generation Configuration

**Symptom:** Certain interfaces or structs are not generated as expected when using `genconfig.Config`.

**Cause:** Incorrect use of whitelist or blacklist filters.

**Resolution:**

- Remember inclusion lists (`IncludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`) take priority over exclusion.
- Wildcard patterns like `Query*` can be used to match multiple interfaces.
- Use full package-qualified names if needed for specificity.
- Confirm your config is declared in the correct Go package and file.
- Example snippet:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
}
```

## Additional Tips

- Run `gorm -h` or `gorm gen -h` for CLI help and flag details.
- Start with simple interface definitions and no config, then incrementally add complexity.
- Use logging or verbose output if supported to trace generation steps.

## Getting Help

- Check [GORM CLI README](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) for usage examples.
- Review related guides:
  - [Installation Instructions](../introduction-setup/installation)
  - [Generating Code](../first-run-generation/generating-code)
  - [Using Generated APIs](../first-run-generation/first-usage)
- Join GORM community channels or GitHub issues for support.
