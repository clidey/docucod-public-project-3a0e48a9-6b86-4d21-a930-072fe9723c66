# Quick Validation Checklist

A fast, systematic way to confirm your GORM CLI setup is properly installed, configured, and running as expected. This checklist guides you through running quick validation checks after each major step—installation, code generation, and API usage—so you can eliminate guesswork and maximize early success.

---

## 1. Validate Installation

Before diving into code generation, ensure the GORM CLI tool is installed correctly and accessible.

### Step 1: Confirm Go Version

Run:
```bash
go version
```

- **Expected outcome:** Go version 1.18 or higher.

- **Why:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ for generics support.

### Step 2: Verify GORM CLI Installation

Run:
```bash
gorm --version
```

- **Expected outcome:** The CLI prints a version string without errors.

- **Tip:** If not found, ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` is in your system PATH.

### Troubleshooting Installation

- If Go is below 1.18, update to the latest stable release.
- If gorm CLI isn't recognized, reinstall using:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

and check your PATH.

---

## 2. Validate Code Generation Setup

Once the CLI is installed, verify your code generation input and output configurations.

### Step 1: Check Interface & Model Files

Ensure you have:
- Go interfaces with SQL template annotations, e.g., `Query[T any]` interface.
- Model structs representing your database tables.
- Optional `genconfig.Config` specifying output and field mappings.

**Example snippet from `examples/query.go`:**
```go
// Query interface with SQL template annotations
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

### Step 2: Run the Generator Command

Invoke:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- Replace `./examples` with the path to your interfaces.
- Replace `./generated` with your desired output directory.

### Step 3: Confirm Generation Success

- The tool prints generating file messages.
- Inspect the output directory; generated `.go` files must be present.

### Step 4: Verify Generated Code

- The generated Go files should parse without errors.
- Look for interface implementations and model field helpers.

---

## 3. Validate Using the Generated APIs

After generation, test the generated query interfaces and field helpers in a simple Go program to confirm functionality.

### Step 1: Initialize a GORM Database Connection

Create a GORM DB session (`db *gorm.DB`) connected to your test database.

### Step 2: Use a Generated Query Interface to Fetch Data

Example code snippet:

```go
import (
  "context"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
  "generated"  // your generated package
  "models"     // your models package
)

func testGetByID(db *gorm.DB, ctx context.Context, id int) error {
  query := generated.Query[models.User](db)
  user, err := query.GetByID(ctx, id)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  fmt.Printf("Fetched user: %+v\n", user)
  return nil
}
```

- Executes a type-safe query with the generated API.

### Step 3: Test Updates Using Generated Interfaces

Example:

```go
err := generated.Query[models.User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, models.User{Name: "newName", Age: 30}, userID)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

- Confirms generated update methods perform correctly.

### Step 4: Run Automated Tests (If Available)

- The `examples/output/query_test.go` file contains tests covering generated queries.
- Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./examples/output/...
```

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                        | Check/Resolution                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CLI not found or version error | Confirm Go install and PATH include `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` |
| No output generated          | Verify your input interface path (`-i`) and code annotations |
| Generated code fails to compile | Check Go generics support (Go 1.18+), ensure consistent package names and imports |
| API queries fail at runtime  | Validate DB connection settings and model definitions match the database schema |

---

## 5. Success Indicators

- `gorm --version` prints CLI version
- Code generation outputs source files without error
- Generated files parse perfectly with `go build`
- Sample queries return expected data without error
- Tests run successfully covering generated code
