# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent setup problems encountered while installing and using GORM CLI. By understanding typical error causes and how to interpret error messages, you will minimize downtime and get your code generation workflow running smoothly.

---

## 1. Go Version Too Low

### Problem
You see errors like:

```shell
Error: require Go version 1.18 or higher
```

### Cause
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or above because it depends on generics and other newer language features.

### Resolution
1. Check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

2. If your version is below 1.18, upgrade Go by following the official installation instructions:

- [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

3. Verify the upgrade:

```bash
go version
```

Should now output 1.18 or newer.

### Tip
Make sure your development environmentâ€™s PATH points to the updated Go binary to avoid conflicts.

---

## 2. Module Import Failures or Package Not Found

### Problem
Errors such as:

```shell
cannot find package "gorm.io/cli/gorm" in any of:
	...
```

### Cause
- GORM CLI module is not installed or properly set up
- Go modules are not initialized

### Resolution
1. Ensure your project uses Go modules (has a `go.mod` file) by running in your project root if missing:

```bash
go mod init your-module-name
```

2. Install GORM CLI with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

3. Add CLI dependencies explicitly if needed:

```bash
go get gorm.io/cli/gorm
```

4. Run `go mod tidy` to sync your module dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

5. Retry code generation commands.

---

## 3. Input Path or Output Path Misconfiguration

### Problem
- No generated files appear
- Errors like:

```shell
error processing /path/to/input: open /path/to/output: no such file or directory
```

### Cause
- Specified input does not point to a valid Go file or directory
- Output directory does not exist or is inaccessible
- Misaligned configuration for output path in CLI flags or `genconfig.Config`

### Resolution
1. Verify your input path (`-i` flag) points to an existing Go file or package directory that contains your interfaces and models.

2. Confirm output path (`-o` flag) is writable by your current user. Create directory if needed:

```bash
mkdir -p ./generated
```

3. If you use a package-level `genconfig.Config`, check if `OutPath` overrides CLI output and matches your intended location.

4. Run the generator with explicit flags:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

5. Check logs for "Generating file" messages confirming output.

---

## 4. Missing or Invalid Configuration File

### Problem
- Generator does not apply expected filters or mappings
- Custom field helpers or path overrides seem ignored

### Cause
- `genconfig.Config` not declared as a package-level var
- Config syntax errors or unsupported definitions
- File structure causes config to be ignored due to file-level settings

### Resolution
1. Ensure your `genconfig.Config` declaration adheres to the following pattern:

```go
package yourpkg

import "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",
    FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
        "json": JSON{},
    },
}
```

2. Place the config in the package where the interfaces and structs to be generated reside.

3. Remember `FileLevel: true` scope applies the config only to the individual file.

4. Run the generator and verify output path and helper types conform to config.

5. Review logs for warnings about ignored configs or conflicts.

## 5. Interpreting Error Output

When running `gorm gen`, if errors occur:

- Read the error messages carefully; they often indicate the file causing the issue.
- Errors during reading or parsing will specify the exact file and line.
- Template rendering errors point to SQL comment annotations or method signatures that have issues.

### Common Scenarios
- **Missing return values:** A method with SQL annotations must have return values ending with `error`.
- **Unsupported SQL DSL:** Avoid using unsupported Go expressions in templates.
- **Unmatched placeholders:** Check that method parameters match placeholders like `@param` in SQL.

### Action
- Fix errors based on messages
- Re-run generator after changes

## 6. Recovery Steps if Generation Fails

1. Verify Go version compatibility.
2. Confirm module and dependencies setup.
3. Validate input files contain properly documented interfaces and models.
4. Simplify interfaces to minimal form to isolate problematic methods.
5. Temporarily remove configuration to test default generation.
6. Check file and directory permissions.
7. Clean previous output directories before regenerating.

---

## 7. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Use absolute or relative paths consistently for input and output.
- Keep interface SQL annotations well-formatted and consistent.
- Use the CLI verbose or debug mode if available for detailed logs.
- Regularly run `go mod tidy` to maintain dependency integrity.
- Review example project files for reference setups.
- Check the README and installation guide for updates or compatibility notes.

## 8. Getting Further Help

- Consult the official [GORM CLI README on GitHub](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/blob/main/README.md) for installation and usage updates.
- Review the [Prerequisites & Installation guide](/getting-started/setup-essentials/prerequisites-installation) for environment setup.
- Visit the [Defining Query Interfaces & Models](/getting-started/first-run-and-validation/defining-interfaces-models) page to ensure your source code meets expectations.
- Engage with the community or open issues on GitHub if problems persist.
