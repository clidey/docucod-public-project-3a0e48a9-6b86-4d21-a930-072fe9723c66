# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent errors encountered during setup and code generation with GORM CLI. Whether you're missing the Go toolchain, facing command-not-found errors, misplacing files, or running into generator crashes, this page provides precise, actionable steps to get you back on track.

## 1. Missing Go Version or Go Not Installed

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** because it utilizes generics.

### Symptoms
- Command `go` is not recognized in your terminal.
- Your Go version is older than 1.18.

### How to Check
Run:

```bash
go version
```
You should see output like `go version go1.18 linux/amd64` or newer.

### Resolution Steps
1. If `go` command is not found, install Go from the official site: https://go.dev/dl/
2. If your version is older than 1.18, upgrade Go before continuing.
3. Ensure your `PATH` environment variable includes the Go binary directory.

<Tip>
Always verify `go version` after installation to confirm proper setup before using GORM CLI.

## 2. `gorm` Command Not Found

After installation, the `gorm` CLI command might not be recognized.

### Cause
- The `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` command installs the CLI into `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.
- This directory may not be included in your system `PATH`.

### Fix
1. Locate your Go bin directory:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

This outputs your GOPATH (e.g., `/home/user/go`). The executable is at `$GOPATH/bin/gorm`.

2. Add this directory to your `PATH`:

- On Linux/macOS, add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- On Windows, adjust your system environment variables accordingly.

3. Restart your terminal or reload your shell profile.

4. Confirm by running:

```bash
gorm version
```

<Tip>
If you recently installed without adding Go bin to your path, open a new terminal session after updating environment variables.

## 3. Incorrect Directory Structure or File Paths

The generator expects your project directory structure and input file paths to meet certain conditions.

### Common Pitfalls
- Specifying a non-existent input path with `-i` flag.
- Placing interface and model files in unexpected or deeply nested locations without proper config adjustments.

### Verifying Your Setup
Check your generation command usage:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./generated-code
```

- The input path must be the directory or file containing your Go interface(s) with SQL templates.
- The output path is where generated code will be written.

### Tips
- Use relative or absolute paths carefully; ensure the input directory actually contains your interfaces.
- Keep related models and interfaces in the same or logically structured directories for easier processing.
- If you have multiple packages, consider using the `genconfig.Config` to specify `OutPath` or filtering interfaces.

## 4. Generator Crashes with Errors During Processing

If you see errors such as parsing failures, method signature issues, or unexpected panics during generation, take these steps:

### Common Error Scenarios
- **Missing method return `error`**: Every SQL method must return error or (type, error).
- **Malformed SQL templates** in your interface comments.
- **Invalid Go code in interfaces or models.**

### How to Troubleshoot
1. **Review your interfaces:**

- Ensure all methods with raw SQL in comments follow the signature rules.
- Methods returning a single value must return `error` type (an error only).
- Methods returning two values must have the second one of type `error`.

2. **Validate your SQL templates:**

- Check comment syntax and placeholders.
- Avoid typos in template directives like `{{where}}` or `@@table`.

3. **Look at error messages closely:**
They usually indicate which file and method caused the problem.

4. **Run the generator with verbose output:**

While not explicitly supported, you can manually add debug prints in the source or generate in a minimal environment.

### Example Error Fix
```go
// Incorrect (missing error return)
FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)

// Correct
FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int) error
```

## 5. File Generation Issues

Generator might not create output files as expected.

### Causes & Fixes
- **Output directory is unwritable:**

  Confirm you have permissions to write to the output directory.

- **Output directory does not exist:**

  The generator creates directories automatically, but verify if the base parent directory exists.

- **Output path conflicts:**

  If you use multiple configs with different `OutPath`, conflicts may arise.

### Tip
Use absolute paths for the output directory to avoid confusion.

## 6. Summary of Troubleshooting Actions

| Problem                | Suggested Action                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Missing Go version     | Install/upgrade Go to 1.18+                  |
| `gorm` command missing | Add Go bin directory to PATH                 |
| Input path issues      | Verify `-i` path points to interfaces       |
| Interface errors       | Fix method signatures; check SQL templates  |
| Output file not created| Verify output dir permissions & existence    |

# Appendices

### Common Commands

```bash
# Verify Go installation and version
go version

# Install or update GORM CLI
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Generate code from interfaces (example)
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Run tests from root module
go test ./...
```

### Basic Example of a Generate Command

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./path/to/generated
```

Make sure the `-i` path includes your annotated Go interfaces.

### Troubleshooting Output Permissions
If you encounter permission denied errors:

```bash
chmod -R u+w ./generated
```
