# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Diagnose and solve frequent problems encountered during installation and first usage of GORM CLI. This guide covers common pitfalls like misconfigurations, missing dependencies, CLI command errors, and environment-related challenges. By following these solutions, you can quickly resolve roadblocks and ensure a smooth start with GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Installation Issues and Verification

### Problem: `gorm` CLI command not found

**Cause:** The GORM CLI binary is not installed, or the `$GOPATH/bin` (or Go bin directory) is not in your system PATH.

**Solution:**

1. Run the installation command explicitly:

```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

2. Ensure that your Go bin directory is in the PATH environment variable.

   - For Unix/macOS:

     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
     # Add this line to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or shell profile
     ```

   - For Windows (PowerShell):

     ```powershell
     $Env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
     ```

3. Verify installation by running:

```bash
   gorm --help
```

Expected output is the CLI help text.

<Check>
If you still see `command not found`, double-check GOPATH settings and try restarting your terminal session.
</Check>

### Problem: Incorrect Go version or missing Go installation

**Cause:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or later due to generics usage.

**Solution:**

1. Confirm Go version:

```bash
go version
```

2. If your Go version is below 1.18, upgrade to the latest version:

- Download from https://golang.org/dl/
- Or use a package manager like `brew`, `apt`, or `choco`

3. After upgrade, re-run the installation command.

## 2. Configuration and Generation Errors

### Problem: No code generated or empty output directory

**Cause:** This usually indicates that the input path or interface definitions are incorrect or filtered out by config rules.

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. Verify you specified the correct input with the `-i` flag (input directory or file containing query interfaces).

Example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

2. Check that your input contains correctly defined interfaces annotated with SQL templates (see [Defining Models and Query Interfaces](./getting-started/core-workflow-quickstart/prepare-models-interfaces)).

3. Review any `genconfig.Config` files (`config.go`) in your input packages for Include/Exclude filters. Ensure interfaces or structs you expect to generate are **included** and not accidentally excluded.

4. If you have multiple configs across nested directories, confirm which configs apply with `FileLevel` enabled or disabled (see the **Basic Generation Configuration** guide).

<Note>
Empty output can also mean that all detected files do not match filter criteria, so carefully review filtering patterns.
</Note>

---

### Problem: Panic or error about method return types in custom interfaces

**Cause:** Interface method signatures do not conform to expected patterns. GORM CLI enforces:

- SQL-decorated methods that return error or (result, error)
- The final return type must be `error` if one value, or the second return value must be `error` if two returned

**Solution:**

- Review your interface methods, ensure signatures end with `error` as the last return type.
- See examples in [Writing Template-Driven Queries](./guides/advanced-patterns/template-based-queries).

---

## 3. Common CLI Usage Pitfalls

### Problem: Flag errors or missing required flags

**Cause:** Missing or incorrect flag like `-i` for input.

**Solution:**

- Always specify the `-i` (input) flag with the path to your Go file or directory containing query interfaces.

Example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

- Use `gorm gen --help` for detailed CLI usage.

---

## 4. Environment and Dependency Issues

### Problem: Module or package import errors during generation

**Cause:** Issues with Go module setup, missing dependencies, or incorrect import paths.

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you have a valid Go module initialized (`go.mod`).

2. Run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

To ensure dependencies like `gorm.io/gorm` and `gorm.io/cli/gorm` are correctly downloaded.

3. Resolve any version conflicts or errors before running generation.

---

### Problem: Generated code formatting errors or cannot compile

**Cause:** The code formatter (goimports) failed or dependencies are missing.

**Solution:**

1. Confirm `goimports` is installed:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

2. Manually format generated code:

```bash
goimports -w ./generated
```

3. Verify generated import paths and ensure your IDE or build system points to the correct module versions.

## 5. Debugging Tips and Best Practices

- Run generation with verbose output by adding debugging prints or modify source if needed.
- Use minimal example interfaces to isolate issues.
- Use included examples under `examples/` directory as baseline references.
- Keep your configs simple initially, then add exclusions/inclusions as you mature your codebase.

## 6. Additional Resources and Getting More Help

- Consult the [Basic Generation Configuration](./getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/basic-configuration) for config file patterns
- Review [First Run and Installation Validation](./getting-started/setup-and-installation/first-run-validation) for confirming initial setup
- Visit the official GitHub repo issues page for community help: [https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/issues](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/issues)
