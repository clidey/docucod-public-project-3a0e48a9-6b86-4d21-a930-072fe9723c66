# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Quickly overcome the most frequent hurdles when installing and starting with GORM CLI. This guide arms you with targeted checks, clear error explanations, and practical fixes so you can get your code generation workflow running smoothly without frustration.

---

## 1. Verify Your Go Version Compatibility

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** due to its use of generics. Using an incompatible version causes installation failures or runtime errors.

### How to check Go version:

```bash
go version
```
Expected output:
```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

### If your Go version is lower:

- Upgrade Go to latest stable release from https://golang.org/dl/
- Ensure your environment variables (`GOROOT`, `PATH`) point to the new Go binary

<Tip>
Using a Go environment older than 1.18 is the leading cause of installation or generation failures. Always double-check your current version before proceeding.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Confirm `$PATH` Configuration Includes Go Binaries

After installing GORM CLI with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`, the binary is placed into your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

If the CLI command `gorm` is not found, your systemâ€™s `$PATH` environment variable may not include this directory.

### How to check your `$PATH`:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

### Add Go bin to your path:

- For Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  # Add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for permanence
  ```

- For Windows (PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  $env:Path += ";" + (go env GOPATH) + "\bin"
  # Update user environment variables for permanence
  ```

### Verify `gorm` command is available:

```bash
gorm --help
```
You should see CLI usage instructions.

<Warning>
Avoid having multiple Go installations conflicting on your system. This causes mismatched versions and unexpected build behaviors.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Handling Common Configuration Mistakes

GORM CLI expects certain inputs and flags to function correctly, especially when generating code.

### Missing or Incorrect `--input` Flag

The `gen` command requires the `--input` (`-i`) flag to specify the path to your Go interface file(s).

Example correct usage:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

If you omit `-i` or provide an invalid path, the CLI will error:

```
Error: required flag(s) "input" not set
```

### Validate Paths:

- Ensure your interface Go source files exist at the `--input` path
- Use relative or absolute paths with correct spelling and casing

### Output Directory Issues

- By default, output is written to `./g`
- You can customize with `-o PATH`
- If you get permission denied errors, verify you have write access

## 4. Common Error Messages and How to Fix Them

| Error Message                                      | Cause                                      | Suggested Fix                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `error processing <input>: <details>`            | Syntax error or file not found in input    | Check file existence and syntax                     |
| `error render template got error: <details>`     | Template generation failure                  | Ensure interface and model files meet DSL rules    |
| `flag required but not set: input`                | Missing `-i` flag                           | Provide input path as `-i ./path/to/interfaces`    |
| `command not found: gorm`                         | CLI binary not in `$PATH`                    | Add Go bin to path, or use full path to `gorm`     |

<Tip>
Running `gorm gen -h` will help confirm your flags and options.
</Tip>

## 5. Verify Your Installation and Environment

To confirm your setup is sound:

1. Check Go version (`go version`)
2. Verify `gorm` CLI command is executable and in `$PATH`
3. Confirm your interface and model files are accessible
4. Run a test code generation command:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

You should see generation messages followed by success confirmation.

If generation fails, review error output to pinpoint issues.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Go version mismatch after upgrade:** Restart your terminal or IDE after upgrading Go to refresh environment variables.
- **Permission denied when writing files:** Check directory permissions and consider running commands with appropriate user rights.
- **Unexpected syntax errors:** Validate your Go code files compile correctly before running the generator.
- **Confusing or silent failures:** Run the CLI with increased verbosity or debug flags if available.

## 7. Getting Further Help

- Consult the [Installation Guide](../essential-setup/installation) for more detailed setup instructions.
- Review [Quickstart & Basic Workflow](../essential-setup/quickstart-your-first-generation) to ensure you follow recommended practices.
- Use community forums or GitHub issues at [https://github.com/go-gorm/cli](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) for specific problems.

<Tip>
Maintaining a clean Go environment and verifying your configuration early saves hours of debugging down the line.
</Tip>
