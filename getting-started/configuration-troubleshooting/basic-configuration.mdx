# Basic Configuration

Configure GORM CLI’s generation behavior to suit your project needs by defining a package‑level `genconfig.Config` variable. This optional configuration lets you customize output paths, tailor field helper mappings, and control which interfaces or structs to generate.

> This page guides you through setting up and using the basic configuration options provided by the `genconfig.Config` struct.

---

## Why Use Basic Configuration?

By default, the GORM CLI generator works without any explicit config, producing output under the CLI command’s `-o` directory and generating code for all suitable types it discovers.

However, customizing generation via `genconfig.Config` empowers you to:

- **Override output paths** per package, organizing generated code effectively.
- **Map Go field types or struct tag names** to custom field helpers, enabling advanced SQL behaviors.
- **Filter interfaces or structs** to generate only a subset relevant for your project.
- **Adjust generation granularity**, such as file‑level vs. package‑level config.

This granular control ensures your generated code fits cleanly within your project structure and coding conventions.

---

## Defining `genconfig.Config`

Create a Go variable at the package level named `Config` and assign it a `genconfig.Config` struct literal. Place this in any file within the package/directory where you want the config to apply.

```go
package examples

import (
    "database/sql"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",

    // Map Go types to specialized field helpers
    FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
        sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
    },

    // Map struct field tags (gen tags) to field helpers
    FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
        "date": field.Time{},  // fields tagged with `gen:"date"` use Time helper
        "json": JSON{},        // example of custom JSON field helper
    },

    // Control which interfaces are processed (optional)
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},

    // Control which structs to generate for (optional)
    IncludeStructs: []any{"User", "Account*"},

    // Optional fine-tuning flags
    FileLevel: false, // applies config at package level
}
```

## Explanation of Key Fields

| Field Name         | Purpose                                                                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OutPath`          | Overrides the CLI `-o` output directory for files generated in the package where this config is declared.
|
| `FieldTypeMap`     | Maps Go field types to field helper instances (e.g., map from `sql.NullTime{}` to `field.Time{}`). This lets the generator select the correct typed helper for those fields.
|
| `FieldNameMap`     | Maps field tag names (e.g., from `gen:"json"`) to field helper instances, allowing specific columns to use custom helpers.
|
| `IncludeInterfaces`| Optionally whitelist interface types for generation, matching names via shell-style patterns or type literals.
|
| `ExcludeInterfaces`| Blacklist interfaces (processed after include-listing).
|
| `IncludeStructs`   | Whitelist struct types to generate helpers for.
|
| `ExcludeStructs`   | Blacklist struct types after whitelist is applied.
|
| `FileLevel`        | If true, config applies only to the current file; otherwise applies across the whole package.

## When to Use Basic Configuration

- You want to **override default output directories** to organize generated code apart from the input source.
- You must **map certain Go field types or custom struct tags** to specialized field helpers for advanced SQL features.
- Your project contains many queries/models but you want to **generate selectively** to limit scope or focus generation.
- You need to apply **different configs in subdirectories or packages** by defining configs in different files.

---

## Simple Working Example

1. Create or edit a Go file (e.g., `examples/config.go`) inside your package:

```go
package examples

import (
    "database/sql"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
    "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",

    FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
        sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
    },

    FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
        "date": field.Time{},
    },
}
```

2. Run the GORM CLI generator specifying your input and output (if different from `OutPath`):

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./examples/output
```

3. The generated files will appear under `examples/output`, and fields matching `sql.NullTime` or tagged `gen:"date"` will use the `field.Time` helper.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Whitelist first, then blacklist:** Use `IncludeInterfaces` or `IncludeStructs` to limit the generation scope. Blacklists filter after whitelists.
- **Use shell-style patterns:** Wildcards (`*`) are supported for matching interface and struct names.
- **Override at package level:** Prefer `FileLevel: false` to apply config across your package rather than per-file for consistency.
- **Map custom fields carefully:** Field mappings should correctly represent the target field helper types to avoid runtime or generation errors.
- **Keep configs per package/directory:** For modular projects, define different configs to customize generation granularly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Basic Configuration Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Generated files do not appear in the specified OutPath">
Ensure your `OutPath` is correctly set relative to your project root. If you use the CLI `-o` flag, it may override the config setting. Avoid conflicting output paths between CLI flags and config.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="FieldTypeMap or FieldNameMap mappings ignored">
Verify that your mapping keys are zero-value instances (e.g., `sql.NullTime{}`) and map to proper field helper types. Also, ensure your imports and type names are correctly referenced.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Config does not apply to some interfaces or structs">
Check your include and exclude lists — if your target types are not matched by `IncludeInterfaces` or `IncludeStructs`, or are filtered by excludes, they won’t be generated. Adjust your wildcard patterns or remove restrictive filters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="FileLevel config is not behaving as expected">
By default, generation config is package-wide (`FileLevel: false`). If you set `FileLevel: true`, ensure you place the config in each file where customization is needed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary
Customize how GORM CLI generates code in your project with a simple package‑level `genconfig.Config` variable. Override output directories, map field types or tags to helpers, and filter which interfaces and structs get processed. This flexible configuration ensures your generated code integrates cleanly and behaves as intended.
