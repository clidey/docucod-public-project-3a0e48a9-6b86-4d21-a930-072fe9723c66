# Common Errors & Solutions

This FAQ addresses the typical problems users may encounter while using GORM CLI, such as version mismatches, generator not detecting files, missing dependencies, or permission errors. Each issue includes clear, actionable solutions to help you get back on track quickly.

---

### 1. Version Mismatch or Unsupported Go Version

**Symptoms:**
- CLI commands fail with errors about unsupported Go versions.
- Generated code is incompatible with your Go environment.

**Solution:**
1. Confirm your Go version is 1.18 or newer, as GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ for generics support.

    ```bash
    go version
    ```

2. If your version is older, update Go to the latest stable release:

    - Download from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
    - Or use a package manager suitable for your OS.

3. Reinstall the GORM CLI to ensure compatibility:

    ```bash
    go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
    ```

4. Verify installation and version:

    ```bash
    gorm version
    ```

<Tip>
Keeping your toolchain up to date ensures compatibility with GORM CLI’s code generation and prevents tricky build issues.

### 2. Generator Not Detecting Query Interfaces or Models

**Symptoms:**
- No output generated or generated files are empty.
- Expected interfaces or structs are not reflected in output.

**Solution:**
1. Check your input path and file structure:

    - The `-i` or `--input` flag must point to a directory or Go source file containing your interfaces or models.
    - You must have at least one Go interface with SQL templates or one model struct.

2. Verify your interface and structs use supported patterns:

    - Interfaces annotated with SQL templates in comments.
    - Models defined as Go structs with exported fields.

3. Review any `genconfig.Config` configuration:

    - Confirm no `IncludeInterfaces` or `ExcludeInterfaces` patterns are accidentally filtering out your interfaces.
    - For file-level configs, verify the `FileLevel` flag is set appropriately.

4. Run the generator with verbose output to check processing:

    ```bash
    gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
    ```

    Watch logs for skipped files or empty interfaces.

5. Make sure your interfaces are exported (start with uppercase letters) and package imports are correctly resolved.

<Warning>
Avoid using interface names that do not begin with uppercase letters or misplaced folders that are outside your module’s Go path.
</Warning>

### 3. Missing Dependencies or Package Imports

**Symptoms:**
- `go: cannot find module` or import errors while running or building generated code.
- The generated files do not import required packages or have unresolved references.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure your Go module dependencies are correctly set up. Run:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

2. Check that your project is using compatible versions of GORM and the CLI.

3. Confirm that your source files import expected packages, especially `gorm.io/gorm` and `gorm.io/cli/gorm/field` as they are required for generated helpers.

4. The generator automatically formats imports; if you experience import issues, rerun the CLI to regenerate with clean state.

5. For custom field helpers (e.g., JSON), verify your `genconfig.Config` entries correctly map these types and imports exist.

### 4. Permission Errors Writing to Output Directory

**Symptoms:**
- Errors like `failed to create directory` or `permission denied` when running generation.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that your user account has write permissions to the output directory specified by the `-o` flag.

2. Check the output directory path:

    - Avoid system directories or restricted paths.
    - Prefer relative or project-local directories.

3. If needed, change ownership or permissions:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) ./generated
    chmod -R u+w ./generated
    ```

4. Alternatively, choose a different output directory where you have full write access using the `-o` flag.

5. If running in a container or CI environment, confirm volume mounts and user contexts allow write access.

<Warning>
Never run generation commands with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and trusted.
</Warning>

### 5. Error Parsing SQL Template Annotations

**Symptoms:**
- Errors or panics mentioning SQL templates or failing to parse method comments.
- Methods without proper SQL template comments cause generation to fail.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure every method intended for generation includes valid SQL templates as comments immediately above the method signature.

2. Follow the template DSL accurately:

    - Use `@@table` to refer to the model’s table.
    - Use `@param` placeholders matching method parameters.
    - Use directives like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}}`, and `{{for}}` correctly.

3. Avoid extra or missing braces and make sure directives are properly closed.

4. Review example syntax in your source interfaces:

    ```go
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)
    ```

5. When multiple return values are used, the last return must be error.

6. Running tests or using verbose CLI output can pinpoint which method triggers parse errors.

### 6. Generated Code Does Not Compile

**Symptoms:**
- Compilation errors referencing generated code (e.g. missing types, interface mismatches).

**Solution:**
1. Confirm your project dependencies are up to date and correctly imported.

2. Make sure your Go version supports generics (Go 1.18+).

3. Validate your interface and struct definitions follow supported conventions.

4. Regenerate code after any changes in interfaces or models to avoid stale artifacts.

5. Inspect generated files in the output directory for unexpected missing imports or incorrect code constructs.

6. Check for conflicts between your own code and generated APIs by verifying package names and import paths.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Run with increased verbosity:** Currently, GORM CLI doesn’t have a verbose flag, but monitoring console output for skipped files or errors helps.
- **Clean output directory:** Remove all generated files before re-running to avoid leftover artifacts causing confusion.
- **Review your configs:** The `genconfig.Config` can silently exclude interfaces or structs if misconfigured.
- **Sample run:** Use the provided `examples/` directory as a reference to isolate issues.

### Getting Additional Help

If you encounter persistent issues beyond these common errors:

- Consult the [GORM CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) for issues or updates.
- Review related documentation pages, particularly:
  - [Quickstart: Your First Workflow](../project-configuration-run/quickstart-overview)
  - [Validating Generated APIs](../project-configuration-run/validating-generated-code)
  - [Installation Troubleshooting](../../setup-installation/installing-cli)

- Open a detailed issue including your Go version, CLI version, error messages, and minimal reproducible example.
