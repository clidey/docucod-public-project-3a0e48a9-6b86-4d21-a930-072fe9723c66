# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you diagnose and fix frequent problems encountered when installing, configuring, or running GORM CLI. Whether facing installation failures, unsupported Go versions, permission errors, or generator errors related to project setup, this page provides clear explanations, actionable diagnostics, and best practices to get you back on track quickly.

---

## 1. Installation Failures

### Symptoms
- `go install` command fails or is not found
- `gorm` CLI command is not recognized after installation
- Version mismatch or unexpected errors during installation

### Checklist & Solutions

1. **Verify Go Version (Go 1.18+ required)**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```
   - GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer for generics support.
   - If your version is older, update Go and reinstall.

2. **Ensure Proper `GOPATH` and Binary Path**
   - Confirm `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
     ```bash
     echo $PATH
     ```
   - If `gorm` binary is not found, manually add `$GOPATH/bin` to your PATH.

3. **Use the Correct Install Command**
   ```bash
   go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
   ```
   - This installs the latest stable version.
   - Do not attempt to clone and build manually unless you are developing the CLI itself.

4. **Check for Proxy or Network Issues**
   - If Go module fetching fails, set a proper `GOPROXY` or check your network.
   - Example for public proxy:
     ```bash
     export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
     ```

5. **Post-install Validation**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     gorm version
     ```
   - If command fails, revisit steps above.

<Note>
Reinstalling with `go clean -modcache` clears cached modules if dependency conflicts occur.
</Note>

## 2. Unsupported or Missing Go Modules

### Symptoms
- Errors about Go version unsupported when running the generator
- Errors such as "unsupported Go version", "cannot find package", or "missing generics"

### Solutions
1. **Check Your Projectâ€™s Go Version**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     go env GOMOD
     ```
   - Inspect your `go.mod` Go version:
     ```bash
     head -10 go.mod
     ```
     Ensure it states `go 1.18` or higher.

2. **Upgrade Project Go Version**
   - Modify `go.mod`:
     ```go
     go 1.18
     ```
     or higher, then run:
     ```bash
     go mod tidy
     ```

3. **Verify Installed Go Version Matches**
   - Running the CLI requires your local Go toolchain matches or exceeds the project Go version.

4. **Enable Modules Mode**
   - Ensure module mode is enabled:
     ```bash
     export GO111MODULE=on
     ```

5. **Verify Generator Compatibility**
   - Use the latest GORM CLI compatible with your Go version.

<Warning>
Attempting to use GORM CLI with Go versions prior to 1.18 will result in unsupported errors. Upgrade Go to proceed.
</Warning>

## 3. File Permission or Path Issues

### Symptoms
- "permission denied" errors when generating or writing output
- Files cannot be created in target directories
- Generator fails with "cannot create file" or "access denied"

### Solutions

1. **Check Output Path Write Permissions**
   - Verify that the directory specified by `-o` flag or `OutPath` in `genconfig.Config` exists and is writable.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ls -ld ./generated
     ```
   - Fix with:
     ```bash
     chmod u+w ./generated
     ```

2. **Create Missing Directories Manually**
   - If directories do not exist, create them:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ./generated
     ```

3. **Avoid Running as Root Unless Necessary**
   - File access issues often arise due to incorrect ownership when running with elevated privileges.

4. **Check for Locked Files**
   - On Windows especially, files in use may prevent overwriting.

<Info>
If using configuration files, make sure the `OutPath` field points to a location you have access to.
</Info>

## 4. Generator Errors Due to Project Structure

### Symptoms
- Missing generated files unexpectedly
- Errors about interfaces or structs not found
- Config filters exclude all interfaces/structs
- Unexpected method signature parsing errors

### Diagnosis & Fixes

1. **Verify Package and File Structure**
   - GORM CLI expects your models and query interfaces to reside in the same or related Go packages.
   - Ensure your `-i` input path targets the directory containing your interfaces and model structs.

2. **Check for `genconfig.Config` Filters**
   - Filters such as `IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, `ExcludeStructs` can exclude generation targets.
   - Review your package-level config file for restrictive patterns.
   - For example, a config with `IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"}` only generates interfaces starting with `Query`.

3. **Confirm Interface and Method Signatures**
   - Ensure methods in your query interfaces have correct signatures:
     - At least one return value ending with `error` is required for query execution methods.
     - Chainable methods have different expectations; see documentation for details.

4. **Check for Unsupported Generic Usage**
   - The CLI requires generic interfaces of the form `interface { ... }` with `[T any]` as type parameter.

5. **Investigate Logs and Errors for Specific Causes**
   - Enable verbose output (if available) or carefully examine error stacks.

<Warning>
Misconfigured filters or incorrect method signatures are common reasons for no output or parse errors.
</Warning>

## 5. Common Error Messages Explained

| Error Message                                    | Meaning                                                | Recommended Action                                |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `unsupported Go version`                        | Your installed Go version is below 1.18               | Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or above               |
| `no interfaces found in input`                  | No interfaces matching filter found                    | Check `IncludeInterfaces` / input path            |
| `method must return error`                       | Interface method lacks `error` as last return value   | Add `error` as last return value to methods       |
| `cannot create file` or `permission denied`    | Output path folder not writable or missing            | Verify directory permissions and existence        |
| `unknown type` or `invalid signature`          | Unsupported or malformed method signature or types   | Review interface definitions                       |

## 6. Troubleshooting Workflow Example

Follow this sequence to diagnose generator or install issues:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm Go Environment">Run `go version` and ensure Go 1.18+ is installed.</Step>
  <Step title="Check CLI Installation">Run `gorm version` to verify CLI is installed and reachable.</Step>
  <Step title="Validate Input Paths">Confirm interface and model files are located under the input directory (`-i` flag).</Step>
  <Step title="Verify Config Filters">Inspect any `genconfig.Config` filters that might exclude interfaces or structs.</Step>
  <Step title="Check Output Directory">Ensure output directory exists and is writable.</Step>

## 7. Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Keep your query interfaces and model structs co-located or properly referenced to simplify generation.
- Use minimal filtering in `genconfig.Config` when starting, then tighten once the process works.
- Regularly update GORM CLI to benefit from bug fixes and new features.
- Leverage the example repository for reference setups.
