# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your GORM CLI setup is correct and fully operational by following this concise checklist. Whether you're confirming installation, checking configuration, or verifying successful code generation and integration, this page guides you through essential verification steps and provides pointers for troubleshooting.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Installation

Verify that the `gorm` CLI tool is installed, accessible, and functioning correctly.

### Step-by-step

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    gorm --help
    ```
3. Confirm that usage information for GORM CLI appears without errors.

### Expected Outcome

- The CLI prints the list of available commands such as `gen`.
- No 'command not found' or permission errors.

### Troubleshooting

- If the command is not found, ensure you have installed the CLI as instructed in the [Install GORM CLI](../installation-setup/install-cli) guide.
- Make sure your Go binary path (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN`) is in your system PATH.

---

## 2. Verify Your Configuration Presence

Check that your project directory has the optional but recommended `genconfig.Config` config declared for customization.

### How to check

- Look for a file or package-level variable declaring `genconfig.Config` in your source directory.
- It typically looks like this:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
    OutPath: "examples/output",
    IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
    // ...other config fields...
}
```

### Why this matters

- Presence of configuration enables fine control over output paths, inclusions, exclusions, and custom field mappings.
- Configuration impacts whether generation filters interface/types properly.

### Tips

- If no config is present, the CLI uses defaults, which works for many simple projects.
- You can safely add or modify the config anytime before generating code to customize behavior.

Refer to [Basic Configuration with genconfig](../config-gen-first-run/basic-configuration) for detailed guidance.

---

## 3. Run the Generator and Confirm Output

Run your first `gorm gen` command and verify that code is generated without errors.

### Command example

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Where:
- `-i` points to your input directory containing your model and query interface source files.
- `-o` is your output directory for the generated Go files.

### What to look for

- Logs like `Generating file ...` confirming files are created.
- Output files such as `iface.go` and `models.go` appearing in output directory tree.
- No error messages during generation.

### Verification steps

Check generated files contain your query interfaces and model field helpers:

- Generated query interface implementations matching your custom interfaces.
- Model helper structs with field predicates like `User.Name.Eq(...)`.

Use the [Quickstart Workflow](../../overview/getting-started-examples/quickstart-workflow) to understand how your input corresponds to these outputs.

### Common issues & solutions

- **No files generated**: Confirm that your interfaces and structs are exported and match inclusion patterns if configured.
- **Error messages**: Review console output, referencing troubleshooting steps in [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../troubleshooting-faq/common-issues).

---

## 4. Validate Integration Into Your Application

Confirm you can use the generated APIs in your code successfully.

### Sample test

Add a simple test or main function that:

- Imports your generated package.
- Calls a generated query method, such as `Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, id)`.
- Verifies no compilation errors occur.

Example snippet:

```go
// Assume generated is your generated package
user, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("query failed: %v", err)
}
fmt.Printf("User: %+v\n", user)
```

### What to expect

- Your project compiles without errors.
- The query runs and returns expected results if connected to a real or test database.

### Tips

- Ensure the `gorm.io/gorm` dependency is correctly installed and up to date.
- Use the [Integration with GORM & Ecosystem](../../overview/getting-started-examples/integration-with-gorm) page for detailed integration examples.

---

## 5. Check for Common Success Indicators

- Generated code files exist and contain your defined interfaces and models.
- No generation or compilation errors.
- Queries and field helpers work as expected in your application code.
- CLI tool responds to commands and sub-commands correctly.

## 6. Next Steps

- Explore generating more complex queries and model helpers.
- Customize generation through your `genconfig.Config`.
- Use association helper methods to manage linked data.

## Troubleshooting Quick Tips

<Accordion title="CLI Not Found or Permission Denied">
- Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` is in your PATH.
- Run `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` again with no errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Generated Files Found">
- Confirm source files contain exported interfaces and structs.
- Check your config filters (Include/Exclude) remove no needed types.
- Inspect console logs for generation info or errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compilation Errors After Generation">
- Check Go version (must be 1.18 or higher).
- Ensure dependencies are installed properly.
- Align your code imports to generated package paths.
</Accordion>

You're now equipped to verify your GORM CLI setup quickly and confidently. Should issues arise, detailed troubleshooting is available in the documentation, and community support channels also provide assistance.

Happy coding!
