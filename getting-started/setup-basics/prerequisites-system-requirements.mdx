# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GORM CLI

Start your journey with GORM CLI by ensuring your environment meets the essential prerequisites. This page outlines the minimal system requirements, key dependencies, and environment considerations so you can set up smoothly and avoid common setup pitfalls.

---

## 1. Minimum System Requirements

To run GORM CLI effectively, your system must meet the following criteria:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later is required due to GORM CLI's use of Go generics
- **Memory**: At least 512MB RAM recommended to handle code generation workloads comfortably
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 100MB of free space for installing GORM CLI and generated files

<Tip>
GORM CLI leverages modern Go features, so Go 1.18+ is **mandatory**. Ensure your `go` command version matches this requirement to avoid incompatibility.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Dependency Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, verify the following:

- **Go Toolchain Installed**: You must have a working Go environment with `go` command accessible from your terminal
- **GORM Library**: While not required for CLI installation, GORM (`gorm.io/gorm`) is necessary for integrating generated code into your project

You can check your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Example expected output:

```bash
go version go1.20.3 darwin/amd64
```

---

## 3. Environment Setup Recommendations

- **Go Modules Enabled**: GORM CLI works best in projects using Go Modules (`go.mod`) for dependency management
- **Project Directory Structure**: Organize your Go interfaces and models in consistent packages to streamline code generation
- **Database Driver Availability**: To use generated APIs with GORM, ensure you have the correct database driver installed (e.g., `gorm.io/driver/mysql`)

<Info>
For the simplest experience, set up your Go workspace with Go Modules enabled (`GO111MODULE=on`), and store your query interfaces and model files in dedicated folders.
</Info>

---

## 4. Compatibility Considerations

- **OS Compatibility**: GORM CLI is a Go command line tool and runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification
- **Go Version Compatibility**: Older Go versions (&lt;1.18) are incompatible due to generic types usage in the generated code
- **IDE Support**: Modern IDEs like GoLand or VSCode with Go extensions fully support GORM CLI usage and code completion for generated code

<Warning>
Attempting to use GORM CLI-generated code with Go versions earlier than 1.18 will cause compilation errors. Upgrade your Go toolchain before proceeding.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Summary of Requirements Checklist

<Check>
- Ensure Go 1.18 or higher is installed and accessible
- Confirm your system has at least 512MB RAM and 100MB free disk space
- Use a project with Go Modules initialized (`go mod init`)
- Install and configure the matching GORM library and database driver for your project
</Check>

## 6. Next Steps

Once your environment is ready, proceed to the [Installation](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation) page to install the GORM CLI tool and begin generating your first type-safe query APIs.

If you face any compatibility issues, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/config-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide for detailed resolutions.

## Troubleshooting Tips for Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Old">
If you see errors or the CLI refuses to run, verify your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Update your Go installation to version 1.18 or higher following the official installation instructions: https://golang.org/doc/install
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Go Modules Support">
Make sure your project has a `go.mod` file. Run:

```bash
go mod init your-module-name
```

This ensures dependency management and compatibility with GORM CLI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Disk Space or RAM">
GORM CLI code generation requires some disk space and RAM to compile and write generated files.

Close unnecessary applications or free space to avoid unexpected failures.
