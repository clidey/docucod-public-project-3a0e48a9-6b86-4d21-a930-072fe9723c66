# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This guide ensures your environment is prepared to run **GORM CLI** effectively. Confirming your system meets these prerequisites will guarantee a smooth installation and operation.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher**. This is essential because GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in Go 1.18 for type-safe code generation.

**Verify your Go version:**

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is older than 1.18, update it to the latest stable release following the official Go installation instructions.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI supports the major platforms compatible with Go:

- macOS
- Linux (x86_64 and ARM)
- Windows (via PowerShell or Command Prompt)

Regardless of OS, make sure Go 1.18+ is properly installed and your environment variables (`GOROOT`, `GOPATH`, `PATH`) include the Go binary.

---

## 3. Hardware and Disk Space

- **CPU & Memory:** Any modern CPU and at least 1 GB of RAM is sufficient for typical code generation tasks.
- **Disk Space:** A minimum of 100 MB free disk space should be available to store the GORM CLI binary and generated code.

---

## 4. Environment Setup

### 4.1 Go Workspace Setup

Ensure your Go environment is properly configured to install binaries:

- `GOPATH` is set (commonly `$HOME/go`)
- `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your system's `PATH`

Verify with:

```bash
echo $GOPATH
which go
which gorm
```

### 4.2 Network Access

Installation and updates require access to the Internet to fetch modules from `golang.org` and the `gorm.io` repositories.

Open outbound TCP port 443 for HTTPS traffic.

---

## 5. Permissions

You need sufficient permission to:

- Install Go binaries (write to `$GOPATH/bin` or your configured binary directory)
- Create and modify files in your project directory where generation output will be stored

---

## 6. Optional Dependencies

No additional software beyond Go is required to run GORM CLI. It generates code based on your Go interfaces and models directly.

If integrating with a database or GORM, ensure you have those dependencies properly installed and configured in your Go project.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<Tip>
If you encounter "command not found" after installation, ensure that your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go install directory is in your system's `PATH` environment variable.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For Windows users, PowerShell or Command Prompt must be run with appropriate privileges to install Go binaries.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using a Go version earlier than 1.18 will cause the CLI to fail silently or produce confusing errors due to missing generics support.
</Warning>

<Info>
Check your Go environment setup by running:

```bash
go env
```

This command prints environment variables key to Go tooling.
</Info>

## Next Steps

Once your environment meets these requirements, proceed to the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation) to install and run GORM CLI.

Explore the [Configuring Your Project](/getting-started/setup-basics/configuration-intro) guide to tailor your generation setup effectively.

---

## Quick Verification Checklist

<Check>
- Is Go 1.18 or newer installed?
- Is your OS supported (macOS, Linux, Windows)?
- Are your Go workspace and environment variables correctly set?
- Do you have network access to fetch Go modules?
- Do you have write permission for your working and installation directories?
</Check>

Confirming these will prepare your system for successful GORM CLI code generation.
