# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common installation and setup problems encountered while installing or configuring the GORM CLI tool. Whether you face version mismatches, missing dependencies, or environment path issues, follow these clear steps to get your installation back on track.

---

## 1. Verify Go Version Compatibility

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or later** due to its use of generics.

### How to Check:

```bash
go version
```

- Confirm the output shows Go 1.18+.
- If not, update Go using your system's package manager or download it from [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/).

<Warning>
Running an older version of Go will cause errors during installation or code generation. Always use Go 1.18 or newer.
</Warning>

---

## 2. Confirm GORM CLI Installation

After installing the CLI via `go install`, verify it is available in your system's PATH.

### Steps:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI usage and commands listed.

If you see "command not found":

- Ensure your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is added to your system PATH.
- For example, add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- Reload your profile (`source ~/.bashrc`) or restart your terminal.

<Tip>
Run `echo $PATH` to confirm your Go bin path is included.
</Tip>

## 3. Check Installation Command and Output

Install GORM CLI correctly with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- Look for any errors during installation, such as missing dependencies or network issues.
- If installation fails:

  - Verify your Go environment variables (`GOPROXY`, `GOPATH`).
  - Ensure you have internet connectivity.
  - Consult error messages for missing packages or permission problems.

---

## 4. Validate the Output Directory Permissions

By default, generated code will be placed in a directory (e.g., `./g` or as specified with `-o` flag).

Issues can occur if:

- The directory does not exist.
- You don’t have write permissions to the output path.

### How to Check:

```bash
ls -ld ./g
```

- Create or adjust permissions if necessary:

```bash
mkdir -p ./g
chmod u+w ./g
```

---

## 5. Diagnose Common Runtime Errors

During code generation (`gorm gen -i ./yourinput -o ./output`), you may see errors related to:

### Version Mismatch or Incompatible Go Modules

- Confirm your Go modules are synchronized and up-to-date.

```bash
go mod tidy
```

- Check your project's `go.mod` matches dependencies needed for GORM and GORM CLI.

### Missing or Unrecognized Input Files

- Ensure the `-i` (input) flag points to a valid Go file containing interfaces annotated with raw SQL templates.
- The input file should compile correctly before running generation.

### Environment Path and Permissions

- The generation process might fail if the CLI cannot write files or access tools.
- Run the command with sufficient permissions.

---

## 6. Environment Path and Shell Configurations

Sometimes shell environments (especially on Windows or macOS) cause path or execution issues.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- On Windows, check that `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` is in the PATH.
- On Unix-like systems, verify `$PATH` includes `$HOME/go/bin`.
- Restart your terminal or IDE to pick up changes.

---

## 7. Reinstalling or Updating GORM CLI

If you suspect a corrupted or outdated installation:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- Optionally, clear Go's module cache:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

- Confirm the update by running:

```bash
gorm version
```

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Example Scenario

Imagine you run:

```bash
gorm gen -i examples/query.go -o generated
```

and receive an error about missing dependency.

### Solution Steps:

1. Check if `examples/query.go` compiles on its own.

```bash
go build examples/query.go
```

2. Run `go mod tidy` to fix dependencies.

3. Ensure `generated/` directory exists and is writable.

4. Confirm `.go` files have no syntax errors.

5. Verify your Go version is 1.18+.
