# Validate Your Installation

This page provides the essential quick tests and commands you need to confirm your installation of the GORM CLI tool is correct and readily accessible. By validating your installation now, you ensure a smooth path towards configuring the CLI and running your first code generation tasks with confidence.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Installation

Before proceeding to configuration and usage, verify that the `gorm` command-line interface (CLI) is installed and can be invoked from your terminal.

### Step 1: Check the CLI Version

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gorm --version
```

#### Expected Outcome:
- The CLI prints the version string, e.g., `gorm version vX.Y.Z`.
- No "command not found" or errors appear.

#### What It Means:
- A successful version check confirms that `gorm` is installed and your PATH environment variable includes the CLI binary location.

### Troubleshooting:
- If the command is not found:
  - Verify you installed the CLI with the Go tool by running:
    
    ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
    ```
  - Confirm your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory is included in your PATH.
  - Restart your shell or terminal session after installation.

<Note>
Tip: On Windows, ensure you include `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` in your system's PATH.
</Note>

## 2. Verify Command Availability

Once the CLI is installed, confirm basic command availability to ensure the CLI is working correctly.

### Step 2: List Available Commands

Run:

```bash
gorm
```

#### Expected Outcome:
- The CLI outputs a list of available commands including `gen`.
- Example snippet:
  
  ```
  GORM CLI Tool

  Usage:
    gorm [command]

  Available Commands:
    gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
    help        Help about any command
  ```

### Step 3: Verify Help for Code Generation Command

Run:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

#### Expected Outcome:
- Command usage instructions for `gen` are displayed.
- Flags such as `-i` (input) and `-o` (output) are shown.

## 3. Confirm CLI Accessibility Programmatically

If you plan to automate or script your usage, ensure the CLI can be called via scripts.

### Example: Check CLI Version in Script

```bash
if gorm --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "GORM CLI is accessible"
else
  echo "GORM CLI not found"
fi
```

Use this check in CI/CD pipelines or environment setups for reliability.

## 4. Next Steps After Validation

Once your GORM CLI installation is verified:

- Proceed to configure your generation input and output paths.
- Create or identify Go interfaces and model structs to generate query APIs and field helpers.
- Run your first generation command using `gorm gen -i <input_path> -o <output_path>`.

Find detailed instructions in the [Installation Guide](../installation) and [Quick Start Guide](../quickstart-sample).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Validation Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="GORM CLI command not found">
- Confirm installation with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Check that your `$GOPATH/bin` (or Go bin directory) is correctly added to your PATH environment variable.
- Restart your terminal or shell.
- On Windows, check system environment variables for PATH and add `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` if missing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version command shows unexpected output or errors">
- Ensure no typos in the command `gorm --version`.
- If using an old CLI, try to update via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Verify your Go environment is correctly set up and Go version 1.18+ is installed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Help command for 'gen' shows usage but errors occur on running">
- Verify you have provided the required `--input` (`-i`) flag pointing to your Go interface source.
- Check directory permissions for reading input and writing output.
- Review error messages to adjust paths or flags.
