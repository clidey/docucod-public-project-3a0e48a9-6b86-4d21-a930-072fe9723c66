# Validate Your Installation

This page guides you through a straightforward process to verify that **GORM CLI** is installed correctly and is fully operational. Before diving into code generation and integration, it’s essential to confirm that the CLI tool can run commands successfully and generate expected outputs.

---

## Why Validate?

Validating your installation ensures:

- The CLI is accessible from your terminal
- The core `gen` command runs without errors
- Basic code generation works with example input

This builds confidence that your environment is ready for development.

---

## 1. Verify CLI Accessibility

First, confirm that the `gorm` command is recognized on your system.

### Step 1: Open your terminal or command prompt

### Step 2: Enter the following command:

```bash
gorm version
```

### Expected outcome:

- The command outputs the version of GORM CLI installed (e.g., `gorm version vX.X.X`).
- No "command not found" or similar errors appear.

<Tip>
If this command returns an error, confirm that your Go binary directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is added to your system's PATH environment variable.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Run a Basic Generation Test

To ensure the CLI can parse and generate code, run a simple example generation.

### Step 1: Prepare example source files

Use the provided `examples/query.go` and `examples/models/user.go` as inputs. These are included in the repository under the `examples` directory and contain sample query interfaces and model structs.

### Step 2: Run the generate command

Navigate to your GORM CLI directory or use the installed CLI globally and execute:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i ./examples` specifies the input directory with your Go interfaces and models.
- `-o ./generated` is your chosen output directory for generated code.

### Step 3: Observe output

You should see console output indicating files are being generated with paths, for example:

```txt
Generating file ./generated/query.go from ./examples/query.go...
Generating file ./generated/models.go from ./examples/models/user.go...
```

No errors should occur.

### Step 4: Confirm generated files

Check the `./generated` directory for new `.go` files. These contain:

- Type-safe query APIs based on interfaces and SQL templates
- Model-driven field helpers for GORM

<Tip>
If the `generated` folder is empty or missing, verify that the input path is correct and the examples directory contains valid Go files.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Run a Sample Generated Query (Optional)

If you want to go a step further, test running the generated code to confirm that the CLI generation is functional.

### Prerequisites

- Go environment properly set up
- A compatible GORM-supported database connection ready
- Your project imports the generated package

### Example snippet:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
	"generated" // replace with your output module path
)

func main() {
	// Open DB connection
	db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("test.db"), &gorm.Config{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	ctx := context.Background()

	// Use generated Query API
	q := generated.Query[generated.User](db)
	user, err := q.GetByID(ctx, 1)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Query failed:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("User:", user)
}
```

Replace `generated` with the correct module path of your generated code.

<Tip>
Use `sqlite` for simple local testing without needing to configure a server.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found">

**Symptom:** Terminal responds with `command not found: gorm`.

**Cause:** Go bin path missing in your PATH environment variable.

**Solution:**

- Add `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` to your PATH.
- Restart your terminal and retry.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Generated Files Created">

**Symptom:** The `gen` command runs, but the output directory is empty.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- Input path is incorrect or has no interfaces/models.
- Interface files lack proper SQL annotations.
- Use `-i` flag pointing exactly to your source interfaces directory.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">

**Symptom:** Write permission errors when generating output files.

**Solution:**

- Check directory permissions of your output folder.
- Use an output path where your user has write access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid Go Code in Output">

**Symptom:** Generated files cause Go build errors.

**Cause:** Possible incompatible Go version or malformed input files.

**Solution:**

- Verify your Go version is 1.18 or higher.
- Validate your input interfaces and model files for syntactic correctness.
- Re-run the CLI.
</Accordion>
