# Prerequisites & System Requirements

To ensure a smooth installation and usage of **GORM CLI**, please verify that your system meets the following requirements. This will prepare your environment for generating type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-based field helpers for your GORM projects.

---

## 1. System Requirements

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or higher is mandatory. GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in 1.18, which is crucial for type-safe code generation.
- **Operating System**: GORM CLI is platform-independent as it compiles Go code. Commonly supported OS include Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Memory & Disk Space**: The tool is lightweight and requires minimal resources. A few hundred MBs of disk space suffice for installation and project code generation.

## 2. Software Dependencies

- **Go Toolchain**: You must have the Go development environment installed and your `$GOPATH`/`$PATH` configured correctly to run Go commands.

```bash
go version  # Should output 'go version go1.18...' or higher
```

- **Database Drivers (optional for usage)**: To use generated APIs against your database, you'll need appropriate database drivers such as `gorm.io/driver/sqlite` or `gorm.io/driver/mysql` installed via Go modules in your project.

## 3. Access & Permissions

- **Filesystem Access**: Write permissions to your project directories where generated code will be output.
- **Database Access**: While not strictly required for code generation, you need valid database credentials and connectivity for operational usage of generated code when running queries or migrations.

## 4. Network Requirements

- No special firewall or port configurations are needed to run the GORM CLI tool itself.
- Network access is required if your project or build involves fetching dependencies or communicating with a remote database.

## Verifying Your Environment

Follow these steps to confirm your system is ready:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go Installation">
Run `go version` in your terminal to verify you have Go 1.18 or newer installed.

```bash
go version
```

The output should be:

```
go version go1.18 <platform>
```

If not, install or upgrade Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Go Path and Environment">
Ensure your GOPATH and PATH variables are properly set so you can execute Go commands and installed binaries.

```bash
echo $GOPATH
which go
```
</Step>

<Step title="Check Disk Permissions">
Confirm write access to your project directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ./test-write && touch ./test-write/test-file && rm -rf ./test-write
```

No errors indicate you have required permissions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Success

- **Use Go Modules** for dependency management in your projects to ensure clean and reproducible builds.
- **Maintain Your Go Version**: Always keep your Go toolchain updated to leverage new language features and security fixes.
- **Check Environment Variables** carefully when experiencing unexpected issues related to binary execution or dependency resolution.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Below 1.18">
If `go version` outputs a version below 1.18, code generation will fail due to lack of generics support.

**Solution:** Upgrade Go by downloading the latest stable version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Go Binary in PATH">
If running `go` commands returns "command not found", your Go binary is not in the system PATH.

**Solution:** Add Go’s bin directory to your PATH environment variable, e.g.,

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Write Permissions">
When the CLI fails to write generated files, it’s likely due to filesystem permissions.

**Solution:** Adjust the directory permissions or choose an output folder where you have write access.
