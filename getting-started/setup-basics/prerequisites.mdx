# System Requirements for GORM CLI

Before diving into using GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the necessary system prerequisites. This page guides you through the essential system dependencies, Go version requirements, and compatibility considerations to guarantee a smooth installation and seamless integration with your GORM projects.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

GORM CLI requires:

- **Go 1.18 or higher**

This minimum version is mandatory because GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced starting from Go 1.18, enabling type-safe code generation.

<Tip>
Always verify your Go installation version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Update if necessary to avoid incompatibilities.
</Tip>

## 2. System Dependencies

GORM CLI is a pure Go tool, so there are no external native dependencies. However, ensure:

- Your **Go toolchain** is installed and correctly configured in your system `PATH`.
- Your environment has network access to fetch modules, especially `gorm.io/cli/gorm` and `gorm.io/gorm` packages.

## 3. GORM ORM Integration

GORM CLI is designed to complement the [GORM ORM](https://gorm.io) ecosystem. Make sure:

- Your project includes `gorm.io/gorm` as a dependency.
- You understand your current GORM version compatibility. GORM CLI integrates seamlessly with the latest GORM releases.

This integration allows for **type-safe query API generation** and **model-driven field helpers** that extend and enhance your ORM experience.

## 4. Supported Platforms and Environments

GORM CLI supports all systems where Go 1.18+ runs smoothly, including:

- Linux (x86_64, ARM)
- macOS
- Windows

No platform-specific configurations are required.

## 5. Network and Access Requirements

- Internet access to fetch Go modules during installation or updates.
- File system permissions to install binaries and write generated code files into your project directory.

## 6. Recommended Development Environment

For the best experience:

- Use an editor or IDE with Go language support (e.g., VS Code with Go plugins) to navigate generated code efficiently.
- Familiarize yourself with Go modules and dependency management.

## Quick Recap

| Requirement           | Details                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Minimum Go Version    | 1.18+                         |
| Operating Systems     | Linux, macOS, Windows         |
| Dependencies         | Go toolchain, `gorm.io/gorm`   |
| Access               | Network for module fetching    |
| File Permissions     | Write access for output files  |

## Troubleshooting System Requirements

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">

If you see errors related to generics or unsupported language features, verify your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Upgrade Go to 1.18 or newer from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing GORM ORM Dependency">

Ensure your `go.mod` file includes `gorm.io/gorm`:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
```

Without this, generated code referencing GORM types will fail to compile.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied on Output Directory">

Make sure you have permission to write in your project or generation output directory.

Use `ls -ld <directory>` or equivalent to check permissions and adjust accordingly with `chmod` or running command as authorized user.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Once your system meets these requirements, proceed with the [Installing GORM CLI](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation) guide to set up the tool, followed by [Validating Your Installation](/getting-started/setup-basics/verification).

## Helpful Commands

Install or upgrade Go:

```bash
# On macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install go
# Or on Linux (using snap)
sudo snap install go --classic
```

Validate Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Install GORM ORM dependency:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
```

Check write permission on output folder:

```bash
ls -ld ./generated
```

Adjust permissions if needed:

```bash
chmod u+w ./generated
```
