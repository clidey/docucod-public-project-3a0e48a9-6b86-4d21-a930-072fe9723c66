# Prerequisites & Requirements

Prepare your development environment to ensure a smooth installation and use of GORM CLI. This guide covers the essential system requirements, Go version constraints, supported operating systems, and software dependencies necessary before you install GORM CLI.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer because it relies heavily on Go generics introduced in this version.

> **Ensure your Go toolchain is updated:**

```bash
go version
# Should output Go version 1.18 or above, e.g., go version go1.19 darwin/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, update it before proceeding to install or run GORM CLI. [Download the latest Go release](https://golang.org/dl/).

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GORM CLI is a Go-based CLI tool and is supported on any OS where Go runs reliably. This includes:

- **Linux** (most distributions)
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (via PowerShell, CMD, or WSL environment)

> **Note:** On Windows, ensure your environment PATH includes the Go binary tools to run `go` commands smoothly.

---

## 3. Dependencies & Environment

Before installing and using GORM CLI, verify the following dependencies:

### Go Toolchain

- Make sure the Go executable (`go`) is installed and accessible from your command line.
- GORM CLI leverages modules and the `go install` command to install itself.

### Network Access

- Internet connectivity is required to download the GORM CLI module via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Firewall or proxy settings should allow Go module fetch operations.

### Development Environment Permissions

- Write permissions to your Go workspace's `bin` directory or the configured GOPATH so the CLI can be installed properly.

---

## 4. Optional: Version Pinning

If you want to install a specific version of GORM CLI, replace `@latest` in the installation command with the desired version tag, for example:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v0.2.0
```

This helps maintain reproducible builds across your development teams or CI systems.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Tips

<Tip>
- Always verify your Go environment variables with `go env`. Ensure `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` are properly set when troubleshooting installation issues.
- Use `go version` to confirm your Go installation before attempting GORM CLI installation.
- If you encounter permission errors during installation, try running the command with appropriate permissions or adjust folder rights.
</Tip>

<Warning>
- Do not attempt to use GORM CLI with unsupported Go versions as the tool relies on generics.
- Avoid running Go commands behind restrictive firewalls without proper proxy or whitelisting.
</Warning>

## 6. Next Steps

With your environment ready, proceed to the next phase:

- [Install GORM CLI](./installation.md): Instructions to download and install the CLI tool.
- [Validate Your Installation](./validation.md): Ensure GORM CLI is functional with verification commands.

| Requirement           | Details                     | Verification Command          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Go Version            | 1.18 or higher              | `go version`                 |
| Operating System      | Linux, macOS, Windows       | Check OS documentation       |
| Network Access        | Internet for go module fetch| Test with `go get` command   |
| Permissions           | Write access to Go bin dir  | Attempt CLI installation     |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Prerequisites and Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
Check if your Go version is below 1.18:

1. Run `go version`.
2. If version is lower than 1.18, download and install the latest Go release.
3. Restart your terminal or IDE to refresh environment settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Executable Not Found">
- Ensure Go is installed.
- Verify that the Go binary path is included in your system PATH.
- Run `go env` to check GOPATH and GOROOT configurations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Issues Preventing Module Download">
- Check your internet connection.
- If behind a proxy, configure Go environment variables (`GOPROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`).
- Temporarily disable restrictive firewalls for Go module traffic.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied on Installation">
- Confirm you have write permission to the Go bin directory.
- On Unix-based systems, consider running the install command with `sudo` if appropriate.
- Alternatively, change GOPATH or GOBIN to a directory with write permissions.
