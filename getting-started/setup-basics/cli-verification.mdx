# Verify Your Installation

Ensure that GORM CLI is properly installed and accessible in your environment by running a simple verification command. This page guides you through validating your CLI installation, confirming your installed version, and troubleshooting common issues related to setup.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Is Installed and Accessible

Before proceeding with code generation, verify that the `gorm` CLI tool is installed and can be invoked from your command line interface.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Your Terminal">
Launch your system’s terminal or command prompt.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Version Command">
Execute the following command to check if GORM CLI is installed and to see the installed version:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected Result:

- You should see the installed version number output, for example: `v0.1.0`
- If the command is not found, the CLI is not installed or not on your PATH.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify CLI Help Command">
To further verify accessibility, run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected Result:

- The CLI’s help menu should display with available commands and options.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you receive a 'command not found' or similar error, make sure you have installed GORM CLI correctly (see the Installation guide) and that your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go binary installation directory is included in your system PATH.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Check Your Environment Setup

Make sure your system environment matches the prerequisites needed for GORM CLI:

- **Go version:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or later.
- **Go bin path:** Your `go install` directory (typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is included in your PATH.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go Version">

```bash
go version
```

Expected Result: Output shows `go version go1.18` or higher.
If Go is missing or outdated, install or upgrade to a supported version.
</Step>
<Step title="Check PATH Environment Variable">
Verify your PATH includes Go binaries:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Look for the presence of the Go bin directory, e.g., `/home/youruser/go/bin`.
If missing, add it following your OS conventions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Quickly Diagnose Common Installation Issues

If the GORM CLI is not recognized or doesn’t behave as expected:

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Steps">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found Errors">
- Confirm you ran `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Ensure your shell environment was reloaded or restarted after installation.
- Add the Go bin directory to your PATH environment variable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Version Command Outputs No Version or Errors">
- Reinstall CLI with `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Verify network connectivity to fetch the package.
- Confirm Go environment variables (e.g., GOPATH) are properly configured.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors During Installation">
- Check file system permissions for the Go bin directory.
- Run the install command with sufficient privileges.
- Alternatively, consider setting a custom GOPATH where you have write access.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Running your terminal as an administrator or using sudo in Unix-like systems may be required if permissions errors persist.
</Tip>

## 4. Validate Successful Installation

Once installed, running the following should confirm the CLI readiness:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

You should see the usage help for the `gen` command:

- Command to generate type-safe code from SQL interfaces
- Flags like `-i` (input interface path) and `-o` (output directory)

Example successful output snippet:

```
Usage:
  gorm gen [flags]

Flags:
  -i, --input string      Path to Go interface file with raw SQL annotations (required)
  -o, --output string     Directory to place generated code (default "./g")
  -h, --help             help for gen
```

---

## Summary

By running the basic `gorm version` and `gorm gen --help` commands, verifying your Go environment, and addressing common setup pitfalls, you establish a solid foundation to begin using GORM CLI efficiently. Successful completion of these steps means your CLI tool is installed correctly and ready for your first generation workflow.
