# Installing GORM CLI

This guide provides you with clear, step-by-step instructions to install GORM CLI across multiple platforms using Go's standard installation mechanisms. You'll learn how to install, update, verify your installation, and understand what to expect once GORM CLI is ready to use.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later is mandatory since GORM CLI leverages generics.
- **Go Environment**: Your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go's bin directory must be added to your system's `PATH` so that you can run installed binaries from the command line.

<Tip>
If youâ€™re unsure about your Go version or environment setup, run `go version` and check your PATH with `echo $PATH` (Linux/macOS) or `echo %PATH%` (Windows).
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

GORM CLI installation uses Goâ€™s native install command, ensuring the latest stable release is fetched directly from the official repository.

### Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Run the Go install command">
Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads and builds the GORM CLI binary and places it in your Go bin directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify installation location">
Confirm that the binary is correctly installed by checking your Go bin folder (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

```bash
ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin | grep gorm
```

On Windows, use:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem (go env GOPATH)\bin | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "gorm.exe" }
```

</Step>

<Step title="Add Go bin to your PATH (if not already done)">
Ensure your system PATH includes the Go bin directory to run `gorm` globally.

- **Linux/macOS**: 

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Add this line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it persistent.

- **Windows**:

Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your system environment PATH via System Properties > Environment Variables.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Alternative installation methods

Currently, the recommended and supported installation method is via Go's install mechanism. There is no official standalone binary or container image.

<Warning>
Avoid installing from third-party package repositories or unofficial sources to prevent security risks or unstable versions.
</Warning>

## 3. Updating GORM CLI

To update to the latest version, simply re-run the Go install command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This replaces the current binary with the newest release.

<Tip>
Keep your Go environment up to date to ensure smooth updates and compatibility.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying Your Installation

After installation, check that GORM CLI is installed properly and accessible.

### Verify version and basic command

Run:

```bash
gorm version
```

Expected output:

```
GORM CLI version x.y.z
```

If `version` is not recognized, try:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see usage and command options.

### Test command execution

Try running the generate command help:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

It should display details about the `gen` command and its flags such as `-i` for input and `-o` for output.

<Check>
If you see these outputs, your installation is successful.
</Check>

## 5. What to Expect After Installation

With GORM CLI installed, you are now set to generate type-safe GORM query APIs and field helpers directly from Go interfaces and model structs.

Typical next steps include:

- Writing your SQL-annotated Go interfaces.
- Setting up your project directory.
- Running `gorm gen` to generate code.

Refer to [Setting Up Your Project](/getting-started/first-codegen/project-setup) and [Generating Code with GORM CLI](/getting-started/first-codegen/generating-code) for practical onboarding.

<Tip>
Run `gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./generated` to generate code customized to your project.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation">
<Accordion title="Command not found after installation">
Check if your Go bin path is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

- Run `echo $PATH` (Linux/macOS) or `echo %PATH%` (Windows) and verify it contains your Go bin directory (commonly `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`).
- If missing, add it as described in the installation steps.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version too low">
Ensure you have Go 1.18 or higher. Run `go version`.

If older, update your Go installation from https://golang.org/dl/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied errors during install">
- Make sure you have proper permissions to write to your Go bin directory.
- Avoid running Go install commands with elevated privileges if not necessary.
- Fix permission issues by changing ownership or running in user mode.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Binary not found in GOPATH/bin after install">
- Confirm Go environment variables by running `go env`.
- Check for any error messages during the install step.
- Make sure the install command finished successfully and your network connection was reliable.
</Accordion>
