# Install GORM CLI

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the **GORM CLI** tool using Go's standard tooling. Follow the instructions to install the latest stable version, update the tool safely, and verify your installation on multiple platforms.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go version 1.18 or higher**: GORM CLI uses Go generics and requires Go 1.18+.
- **Supported Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, and Windows are all supported.
- **Go environment properly configured**: Ensure your `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` are set up so that Go binaries can be installed and invoked from the command line.

### Verify Go Installation

Run this command to confirm your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

Expected output should look like:

```bash
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
```

If your Go version is below 1.18, upgrade Go before proceeding.

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go binary and can be installed using `go install`.

> **Note:** The installation follows Go's module-aware approach and requires network access to fetch the package.

### Basic Installation Command

Run the following command to install the latest version of GORM CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads, compiles, and installs the CLI binary into your Go binary directory (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

### Verify Installation

After installation, check if the binary is accessible:

```bash
gorm version
```

If you see version or help output, the installation is successful.

> **Tip:** If you receive a 'command not found' error, verify that your Go binary directory is in your system’s `$PATH` environment variable.

---

## 3. Recommended Practices

### Adding Go Bin Directory to PATH

If you haven’t already, add the Go binary folder to your system PATH:

- **Linux/macOS (bash/zsh)**

  Add this to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**

  Add the Go bin folder to your system environment variables or run:

  ```powershell
  $env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
  ```

Restart your terminal session after changes.

---

### Installing a Specific Version

If you need a version other than the latest, specify the version tag:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v1.2.3
```

Replace `v1.2.3` with the desired release.

### Updating to the Latest Version

To upgrade to the newest version, re-run the install command with `@latest`:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This will overwrite the binary with the latest release.

## 4. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Make sure your Go bin directory (e.g., `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your system’s PATH environment variable. After adding it, restart your terminal or source your profile.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Conflicts or Older Go Installed">
Verify Go version with `go version`. If lower than 1.18, upgrade Go from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues During go install">
Ensure that your environment has outgoing internet access. Set up Go proxy settings if behind a network proxy:

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied When Installing">
Make sure you have write access to the Go bin directory. Avoid installing as root; instead, fix folder permissions or use a local Go workspace.
