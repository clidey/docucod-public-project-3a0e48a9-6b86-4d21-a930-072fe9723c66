# Installation Guide for GORM CLI

This installation guide walks you through installing GORM CLI using standard Go tooling in a platform-agnostic manner. It also provides troubleshooting advice for common permission or environment issues encountered during installation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or higher (generics support required)
- **Go Environment**: Properly configured Go workspace with `GOPATH` and `PATH` set
- **Network Access**: Ability to download modules and binaries from the internet

<Tip>
If you don't have Go installed, please visit the official Go installation page: https://golang.org/doc/install
</Tip>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module and can be installed via the `go install` command. This method works consistently across Windows, Linux, and macOS, provided your Go environment is configured correctly.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt**

2. **Run the install command:**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- This command fetches the latest version of GORM CLI and installs it into your Go binary directory.

3. **Verify installation:**

- Ensure the Go bin directory is available in your system `PATH`. This directory is typically `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`.

- Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- You should see the CLI help output indicating GORM CLI is installed and ready.

<Check>
If `gorm` command is not found, you likely need to add the Go binary directory to your system PATH.
</Check>

## 3. Common Permission and Environment Issues

Some users may encounter permission issues or environment conflicts during installation. Below are common problems and solutions.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
If you see errors related to permission denial or lack of write access when running `go install`, try the following:

- Check that your Go bin directory is writeable by your user.
- Avoid running `go install` as root or administrator to prevent permission mismatches.
- If installed previously, remove any conflicting `gorm` executable from system directories.

If persistent, consider changing the Go module cache directory permissions or use a different installation path.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GORM Not in PATH">
If `gorm` command is reported as not found after installation:

- Confirm where Go installs binaries via:

```bash
go env GOBIN
```

or fallback to:

```bash
echo $GOPATH/bin
```

- Add the directory printed to your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable.

- Restart your terminal or shell to apply changes.

Example adding to PATH (Linux/macOS):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Windows users should add the Go bin path to the system environment variables via System Properties.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Proxy or Network Connectivity Issues">
If your environment uses a strict proxy or firewall, `go install` may fail to fetch modules:

- Set the Go proxy environment variable, e.g., `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org`
- Check connectivity to `gorm.io` domain.
- Consult your network administrator if corporate proxies require additional configuration.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Verifying Your Installation

After successful installation, ensure GORM CLI works as expected.

### Steps

1. Run the command:

```bash
gorm --version
```

- You should see the version number output.

2. Run help to explore commands:

```bash
gorm --help
```

- This will display available commands like the `gen` subcommand used for code generation.

3. To test the tool further, navigate to a Go project directory with defined interfaces and run:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

- This should generate query API code according to your interfaces.

## 5. Best Practices

- Always use the latest stable Go version to keep compatibility smooth.
- Install tools using `go install` outside of module projects to avoid module conflicts.
- Keep your Go environment variables properly configured, especially `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`.
- Use version locking in your projects by specifying CLI versions explicitly if needed (e.g., `gorm.io/cli/gorm@vX.Y.Z`).

## 6. Next Steps

Once installation is verified, proceed to:

- Define your models and query interfaces ([Define Models and Query Interfaces](../first-gen-workflow/define-models-interfaces))
- Generate your first GORM CLI code ([Generate Code](../first-gen-workflow/generate-code))
- Use the generated APIs in your application ([Using the Generated APIs](../first-gen-workflow/using-generated-apis))
