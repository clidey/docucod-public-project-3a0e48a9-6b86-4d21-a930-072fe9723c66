# Installing GORM CLI

This guide walks you through the step-by-step installation of the GORM CLI tool across different platforms using Go tooling. By the end, you will have GORM CLI installed and ready to run from your terminal, enabling you to generate type-safe database query code seamlessly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Go version**: You must have Go 1.18 or newer installed since GORM CLI relies on generics introduced in Go 1.18.
- **Go environment configured**: Your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` should be set up correctly, and `go` commands should be accessible via your terminal.
- **Supported platforms**: GORM CLI is compatible with major operating systems supported by Go (Linux, macOS, Windows).

<Tip>
If you do not have Go installed or are unsure about your version, run:

```bash
go version
```

and download the latest Go from https://golang.org/dl/ if needed.
</Tip>


## 2. Installation Instructions

The most straightforward way to install GORM CLI is with the Go toolchain's `go install` command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### What this does:

- Downloads the latest GORM CLI source code.
- Builds the binary.
- Installs it to your `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `$HOME/go/bin`).

### Verify `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system PATH:

You need to ensure the installation directory is part of your `PATH` environment variable so you can run `gorm` anywhere.

- On Linux/macOS, add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- On Windows, add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your system PATH.

### Confirm Installation

To confirm the CLI installed successfully, run:

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see version information or a help message indicating it is ready.

<Check>
If `gorm` is not found after installation, verify your PATH includes your Go bin directory and restart your terminal.
</Check>

## 3. Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux/macOS

- Ensure Go is installed using official binaries or your OS package manager.
- Run the install command in a terminal.

### Windows

- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt.
- Confirm Go binaries are accessible.
- Add Go bin folder to PATH if the `gorm` command is not recognized.

### Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
If you see "command not found" after running `go install`:

- Verify `$GOPATH/bin` or `%GOPATH%\bin` is in your system `PATH`.
- Restart the terminal session to refresh the environment.
- Run `go env GOPATH` to confirm installation path.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied or Access Errors">
- On Linux/macOS, ensure you have write permission to your Go bin directory.
- Avoid using `sudo` to install Go tools; fix permissions on your GOPATH instead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Using an Older Go Version">
- GORM CLI requires Go 1.18+ for generics support.
- Upgrade by downloading the latest Go release from: https://golang.org/dl/
- Verify the updated version with `go version`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Post-Installation: Ready to Run GORM CLI Commands

Once installed, you can start using GORM CLI immediately to generate code.

### Basic check: display help

```bash
gorm help
```

You should see the list of available commands like `gen`.

### Running your first code generation

1. Prepare your Go project with query interfaces and models.
2. Run the generator with:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./output/directory
```

This kicks off the code generation based on your interfaces.

<Tip>
Use the `--help` flag with any command for detailed usage:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```
This explains available flags such as `-i` for input and `-o` for output.
</Tip>
