# Installation Instructions for GORM CLI

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install the GORM CLI tool using Go. It covers platform-agnostic installation via the Go toolchain, describes verification methods, and offers troubleshooting tips to overcome common issues such as Go not found errors or version mismatches.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

- **Go Version**: Ensure Go 1.18 or higher is installed, as GORM CLI requires generics support.
- **Operating System**: Supported on all major platforms where Go can run (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Environment Path**: Go’s `bin` directory must be included in your system’s `$PATH` environment variable.

<Tip>
Verify your Go installation and version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Example output for a compatible version:
```
go version go1.20.3 linux/amd64
```
If Go is not installed or the version is below 1.18, install or upgrade it before proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module and installed via the `go install` command.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the latest GORM CLI:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

3. After installation completes, your Go bin directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`) should contain the `gorm` executable.

### Verify Installation

Run the CLI with:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output:

```
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm
```

If you see this help message, installation succeeded.

## 3. Common Installation Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="Go Not Found or 'command not found'">
If running `go` or `gorm` commands returns a "command not found" error:

- Confirm Go is installed with `go version`.
- Add Go’s bin directory to your `$PATH`. For example, add the following line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```
- Restart your terminal or source your profile: `source ~/.bashrc`.
- Retry running `gorm --help`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Below 1.18">
GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to generics usage.

- Check version: `go version`.
- Download and install the latest Go version from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
- After updating, reinstall GORM CLI using the install command.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission or Path Issues on Windows">
- Ensure Go bin directory is added to Windows Environment Variables `Path`.
- Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator if permission denied errors occur.
- If `gorm.exe` is not found, verify `go env GOPATH` and look for `gorm.exe` under `GOPATH\bin`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If you installed Go recently and commands still fail, reboot your system to refresh environment variables.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Installation Methods

### Go-Specific Method (Recommended)

- Uses `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` to install directly from the Go module proxy.
- Ensures you get the latest tagged release.
- Automatically places the binary in the Go bin directory.

### Alternative Approaches

- **Manual Build from Source**: Clone the repository and build with `go build`.
- **Pre-built Binaries**: Not officially provided; recommended to use Go install method.

The Go install method is preferred for simplicity, automatic updates, and platform independence.

---

## 5. What to Do After Installation

- Confirm `gorm` CLI is callable from any terminal window.
- Proceed to write your query interfaces and models, then generate your first code using `gorm gen` command.

See [Writing Models and Query Interfaces](/getting-started/first-steps/write-models-interfaces) and [Generating Code for the First Time](/getting-started/first-steps/run-generator) for next steps.

---

## 6. Optional: Verify Environment Variables

Run the following commands to verify where Go and GORM CLI are installed:

```bash
which go    # Linux/macOS
where go    # Windows
which gorm  # Linux/macOS
where gorm  # Windows
```

Check for expected paths. If `gorm` is missing, verify Go bin directory is correctly added to your PATH.

---

## 7. Summary Checklist

<Check>
- Go version is 1.18 or higher
- Go binary directory is in system PATH
- Installed GORM CLI via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`
- Verified `gorm --help` runs successfully
- Resolved common environment or permission issues
</Check>
