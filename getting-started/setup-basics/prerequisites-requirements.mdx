# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your environment is fully prepared to use **GORM CLI**, the code generation tool that augments your Go projects with type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-driven field helpers.

This guide walks you through verifying your system setup, understanding necessary software requirements, and key environment considerations so you can start generating GORM query code smoothly and efficiently.

---

## 1. Supported Go Version

- GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** to support generics, which are fundamental for the generated type-safe APIs.

- Confirm your Go version by running:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

  Expected output example:

  ```
go version go1.18 linux/amd64
  ```

- If your version is older, update Go before proceeding.

<Tip>
Using Go 1.18+ unlocks all type-safety features of GORM CLI, enabling generics-based query APIs and field helpers.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GORM CLI is designed as a **Go command-line tool** compatible with all platforms supported by Go itself:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

Verify your platform compatibility by confirming Go runs correctly.

<Warning>
Some shell scripts or tooling may vary by OS. When running CLI commands or scripts (like tests), ensure your shell environment matches expected platform conventions.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Core Dependencies

- **Go toolchain**: Installed and available in your system `PATH`.

- **GORM** library:
  - The generated code seamlessly integrates with `gorm.io/gorm`. Make sure your project already imports GORM or add it via:

  ```bash
  go get gorm.io/gorm
  ```

- **GORM CLI itself** (the generator tool):

  Install the CLI globally with:

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```

  This places a `gorm` binary in your Go bin directory.

<Check>
Verify that `gorm` command is callable:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expect usage details confirming installation.
</Check>

---

## 4. Development Workflow Environment

Since GORM CLI generates code for Go projects that use GORM, ensure your development environment follows typical Go project conventions:

- Use **Go modules** (`go.mod`) for dependency management.

- Organize your project with source code and interface definitions under standard directories.

- No special environment variables or permissions are required to run the CLI beyond standard Go tooling access.

<Info>
GORM CLI expects your interfaces and models to be local Go source files it can parse to generate the query code.
</Info>

---

## 5. Network and Connectivity

- The CLI tool does not require any network connectivity for code generation itself.

- You must have internet access only for:
  - Installing Go modules
  - Running `go install` for GORM CLI or dependencies

- No special firewall or port settings are necessary.

---

## 6. Summary Checklist

Before you start using GORM CLI, confirm the following:

- [ ] Go version is 1.18 or higher.
- [ ] GORM CLI tool installed (`gorm` command available).
- [ ] Your project uses or includes `gorm.io/gorm` dependency.
- [ ] Go environment variables (`GOROOT`, `GOPATH`) are configured correctly.
- [ ] Source directories contain your interfaces and models.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Issues">
If `go version` reports a version older than 1.18:

- Upgrade Go to the latest stable release.
- Remove old Go installations if needed.
- Confirm your shell and IDE pick up the correct Go binary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CLI Not Found After Installation">
If after installation `gorm` command is not found:

- Confirm `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` or `$(go env GOBIN)` is in your PATH.
- Restart your terminal after installation.
- Optionally, run the CLI with full path: `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Errors in Generated Code">
Ensure your `go.mod` includes `gorm.io/gorm` module.

Run:

```bash
go get gorm.io/gorm
```

and then rebuild your project.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. How System Requirements Align with Your Workflow

Using GORM CLI fits naturally into a standard Go development cycle:

- Write your query interfaces and model structs locally
- Run `gorm gen` with the appropriate input directory and output path
- Import the generated code into your project
- Build and run with type-safe query APIs

Understanding your environment readiness prevents common pitfalls and ensures smooth initial setup and future iterations.

<Check>
Ensure the above requirements are met before proceeding to installation and first generation steps to avoid setup issues.
</Check>

By confirming your environment against these system requirements and prerequisites, you'll be poised to leverage GORM CLI's productivity and type safety benefits immediately and effectively.

---

# Example: Verify Go Version and Install GORM CLI

```bash
# Check Go version
go version

# Install GORM CLI
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Verify CLI command availability
gorm --help
```

Successful execution of these commands confirms your system is ready for GORM CLI usage.
