# Validating Your Installation

Ensure your GORM CLI installation is correctly set up and fully operational before beginning your development workflow. This guide provides straightforward commands and verification steps so you can confidently move forward with generating and using code.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Accessibility

First, check that the `gorm` CLI tool is installed and accessible from your command line environment.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check CLI Version">
Run the following command to verify the GORM CLI installation and display its current version:

```bash
gorm --version
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- CLI displays the installed version number without errors.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If `gorm: command not found` appears, confirm you have installed the CLI via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.
- Verify your `$GOPATH/bin` or equivalent Go binary path is included in your system `PATH`.
</Step>
<Step title="List Available Commands">
Verify the CLI shows available commands by running:

```bash
gorm help
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- The CLI lists commands like `gen` for code generation.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If no commands appear, reinstall the CLI or check for corrupted installation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Test Code Generation Setup

After confirming the CLI is installed, test your setup with a sample generation command.

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare a Sample Interface Package">
Create a sample Go package with an interface to use for code generation, for example:

```go
// examples/query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
    // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
    GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}
```

This minimal interface defines a basic query method with an SQL template.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Code Generation">
Execute the generator targeting your sample package:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` points to the input directory containing your interfaces.
- `-o` specifies the output directory for generated code.

**Expected Outcome:**
- CLI outputs progress messages about file generation.
- Generated source files appear under `./generated`.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Generated Files">
Confirm generated files exist and compile.

```bash
ls ./generated
```

Try compiling your project to verify correctness:

```bash
go build ./generated
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- No compile errors.
- Generated Go files include type-safe query APIs.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 3. Run Automated Tests (Optional but Recommended)

Run the included tests that verify example queries and generation logic.

```bash
bash scripts/test_all.sh
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Tests run successfully without failures.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check your `MYSQL_DSN` environment variable for correct database access (default: MySQL running at 127.0.0.1:9910).
- Confirm database is running and credentials are correct.

## 4. Interpret Validation Results

### Success Indicators

- The `gorm` CLI responds correctly to `--version` and `help` commands.
- Code generation completes without errors, producing valid Go source files.
- Generated code compiles in your project.
- Tests pass (if run).

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                                      | Cause                                      | Solution                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `gorm: command not found`                   | CLI not installed or PATH misconfigured     | Reinstall CLI; add `$GOPATH/bin` to PATH    |
| Generation command fails or errors         | Incorrect input path or code issues        | Verify interface location and syntax        |
| Generated code fails to compile            | Version mismatch or incomplete interfaces  | Confirm Go version 1.18+ and correct code   |
| Tests fail due to DB connection             | Wrong DSN or DB not running                 | Configure `MYSQL_DSN` and run MySQL server  |

## 5. Next Steps

Once validation succeeds, you are ready to:

- Define your own query interfaces and models following [Creating Models & Query Interfaces](../first-code-gen/writing-models-interfaces).
- Run full code generation in your project with [Running the Generator](../first-code-gen/running-generator).
- Explore how to use generated APIs in your code base via [Using the Generated Code](../first-code-gen/first-use).
- For troubleshooting any setup issues, see [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../troubleshooting-validation/troubleshooting).
