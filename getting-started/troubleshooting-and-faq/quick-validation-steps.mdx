# Quick Validation Steps

A reliable code generation pipeline is key to smoothly integrating GORM CLI into your development workflow. This checklist helps you quickly validate your GORM CLI installation and code generation process to ensure that your project setup is correct and functioning as expected. Use this guide whenever you set up a new environment or encounter unexpected behavior.

---

## 1. Confirm GORM CLI Installation

Before validating code generation, ensure the CLI tool is installed properly and available in your system PATH.

### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go Version">
Ensure your Go version is 1.18 or later, as GORM CLI requires Go generics.

```bash
go version
# Expected output: go version go1.18 or higher
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify CLI Installation">
Confirm the GORM CLI binary is installed and callable.

```bash
gorm version
# Expected output: CLI version info or usage summary
```

If `gorm` command is not found, install or add to your PATH:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Make sure your Go environment variables (like `GOPATH` and `PATH`) are set correctly to locate installed binaries.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Validate Input Source Code

Your input should contain properly defined Go interfaces with SQL template comments and Go structs as models.

### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Interface Syntax and Comments">
Open your SQL interface file and verify:

- You have Go interfaces with methods documented by SQL template comments.
- Parameters in comments match method signatures.

Example excerpt from `examples/query.go`:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id AND name = "@name"
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Models Are Defined Properly">
Models should be Go structs with exported fields.

Example excerpt from `examples/models/user.go`:

```go
type User struct {
  ID uint
  Name string
  Age int
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Interface method return types must include error as the last returned value, and maximum two return values are allowed.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Run the Code Generator

Use the `gorm gen` command to generate code from your interfaces and models.

### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Execute the Generator">

Run:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

Expected output:
- Confirmation of files processed
- Generated files in the specified output directory (default `./g` if not overridden)

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Generated Files Exist">
Navigate to the output directory and ensure files were created:

```bash
ls ./generated
```

You should see Go files corresponding to your input, e.g., `query.go`, `models_field_helpers.go`.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use your `genconfig.Config` to control output locations and filter which interfaces or structs are generated.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Inspect Generated Code

Review the generated code for correctness and completeness.

### Actions:

- Open generated Go files and check:
  - Presence of generated interfaces and their methods.
  - Struct field helper variables for each model’s fields.
  - Proper import statements, including GORM and field helpers.

Example snippet from generated field helpers:

```go
var User = struct {
  ID field.Number[uint]
  Name field.String
  Age field.Number[int]
}{
  ID: User.ID.WithColumn("id"),
  Name: User.Name.WithColumn("name"),
  Age: User.Age.WithColumn("age"),
}
```

- Check code formatting and syntax (should be well formatted and compile):

```bash
go fmt ./generated/...
go build ./generated/...
```

<Tip>
Running tests included in your codebase is a good practice to validate generated code behavior.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Run Sample Queries Using Generated APIs

Validate the generated APIs work with your GORM DB instance.

### Sample Test Flow:

1. Set up a test database including sample data.
2. Use generated APIs to query, create, update, and delete records.

Example usage:

```go
// SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=123
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Error fetching user: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println(user.Name)
```

3. Run field helper queries:

```go
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
```

4. Confirm results as expected, no runtime errors.

<Warning>
Ensure your GORM DB connection is valid and your database schema matches your models.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshoot Common Issues

If validation steps fail, consider:

- **Installation issues:** Verify Go version and CLI installation.
- **Parsing errors:** Check for syntax mistakes or missing comments in interfaces.
- **No files generated:** Confirm input path correctness and config filters.
- **Generated code compile errors:** Validate Go code formatting and dependencies.
- **Runtime errors with generated APIs:** Ensure DB connectivity and schema alignment.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../troubleshooting-and-faq/common-issues) guide for detailed diagnostics.

## 7. Next Steps

Once validation passes, explore the following to deepen your GORM CLI knowledge:

- [Defining Models & Query Interfaces](../your-first-code-generation/defining-models-interfaces) to extend and refine your interfaces
- [Using the Generated APIs in Your Application](../../guides/core-workflows/using-generated-apis) for advanced usage
- [Customizing Code Generation](../installation-and-setup/configuration-setup) with `genconfig.Config`
- [Adding Custom Field Helpers](../../guides/advanced-usage/json-field-helpers) like JSON or custom types
