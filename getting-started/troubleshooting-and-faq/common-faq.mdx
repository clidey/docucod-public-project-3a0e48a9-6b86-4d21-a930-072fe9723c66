# FAQ: First Run & Validation Issues

This FAQ page addresses common questions and obstacles faced when running GORM CLI for the first time, generating code, locating output files, and using the generated APIs. It helps you quickly overcome initial hurdles to ensure a smooth experience.

---

## 1. Why can’t I find my generated code?

The default output directory for GORM CLI code generation is `./g` unless overridden by the `-o` flag or a `genconfig.Config`.

### How to locate your generated files:

- If you run the command as:
  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./examples
  ```
  your generated files appear under `./g/examples/` maintaining the package structure.

- To specify a custom output directory:
  ```bash
  gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
  ```
  This will place all generated files under `./generated/examples/`.

- You can also declare `OutPath` in a package-level `genconfig.Config`:
  ```go
  var _ = genconfig.Config{
      OutPath: "examples/output",
  }
  ```
  This overrides the CLI default.


<Tip>
Use the exact output path you intend to check after generation, as the tool preserves package paths under the output directory.
</Tip>

## 2. I ran `gorm gen` but get no files or no interfaces generated. What’s wrong?

### Common causes:

- **Missing or incorrect `-i` (input) flag**: The `-i` flag must point to a Go interface file or directory containing interfaces annotated with SQL templates.

- **Filters applied by configuration**: If you have a `genconfig.Config` (e.g., in your package) that uses include/exclude filters (`IncludeInterfaces`, `ExcludeInterfaces`, `IncludeStructs`, `ExcludeStructs`), interfaces or structs can silently be excluded.

- **No exported interfaces or structs**: Only exported Go interfaces and structs are processed; unexported ones are ignored.

- **Incorrect interface method comments**: Methods must have SQL template comments to be detected; otherwise, they won't generate code.

### What to do:

- Verify your input path and contents.
- Check for presence of interfaces with `//` comment SQL templates above methods.
- Review `genconfig.Config` to ensure filters allow your interfaces and structs.
- Look for diagnostic messages on CLI output about skipped files or interfaces.

<Tip>
Run your command with verbose logging or check console messages to identify skipped files.
</Tip>

## 3. I see errors about method return values or signatures during `gorm gen`. How to fix?

Every interface method that has an associated SQL must follow GORM CLI signature rules:

- Methods returning data must have either:
  - Two return values: `(DataType, error)`
  - Or one return value: `error` for non-query finish methods.

- The last returned value must always be `error`.

- Methods representing chainable filters with no SQL returned do not return any value.

Errors often arise if the method returns zero, one, or more than two return values, or the last type isn’t `error`.

### How to fix:

- Adjust method signatures in your interface to conform:

```go
// Correct example
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
UpdateUser(user User, id int) error
FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
```

- Ensure the SQL annotation comment exists immediately before the method.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Template-based Queries](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/#template-based-queries) documentation for examples.
</Tip>

## 4. The generated APIs don’t seem to work as expected during queries or updates. What now?

### Common pitfalls:

- Forgetting to pass `context.Context` when calling generated methods (added automatically by generator if omitted in interface).

- Misunderstanding generated method semantics: some methods return query interfaces, others perform immediate operation.

- Not initializing your database connection correctly or passing `*gorm.DB` to generated API constructors.

- SQL Template syntax errors causing incomplete or faulty queries.

### How to troubleshoot:

- Use generated package imports and instantiate query interfaces correctly:

```go
// Instantiate with your gorm.DB instance
query := generated.Query[models.User](db)

// Use context when invoking methods
user, err := query.GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

- Confirm your SQL template comment uses proper syntax and placeholders.

- Look for runtime errors from GORM when executing queries.

- Use the examples from `examples/output/query_test.go` as references.

## 5. How to verify the generated code and my first run?

### Step-by-step verification:

1. Run code generation:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

2. Confirm generated files exist under `./generated/examples/`.

3. Write a simple Go test or main program to instantiate your query interface:

```go
query := generated.Query[models.User](db)
user, err := query.GetByID(ctx, 1)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(user)
```

4. Confirm the output matches expected data.

5. Update a record using a generated update method and verify the database.

Refer to the [Quick Validation & Example Run](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/first-steps/first-validation) for a detailed walkthrough.

---

## 6. The CLI reports "unknown flag" or "command not found". How to resolve?

- Ensure you have installed the GORM CLI correctly:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

- Verify your Go bin directory is on your system PATH.

- Confirm your Go version is 1.18 or higher.

- Run `gorm --help` to check if the CLI is recognized.

- Use the full path to the binary if PATH is not configured.

---

## 7. Can I customize generation behavior or mappings?

Yes! You can declare a package-level `genconfig.Config` struct to customize:

- Output paths
- Interface and struct inclusion/exclusion
- Type and field name mappings to custom field helpers

See the [Basic Configuration Setup](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/first-steps/basic-configuration) and examples in your source packages.

---

## 8. Where to get help if I face issues?

- Review the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](https://gorm.io/cli/gorm/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-faq/troubleshooting) guide.
- Ask questions in Go or GORM community forums and GitHub Issues.
- Review examples in `examples/` directory of the repository.

## Summary of Common Commands

```bash
# Install GORM CLI (requires Go 1.18+)
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Generate code from input directory, output to default ./g
gorm gen -i ./examples

# Generate code to custom output directory
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Generate from a specific file
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go
```
