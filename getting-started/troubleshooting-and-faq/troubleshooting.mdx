# Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

This guide addresses the most common issues encountered during the installation and initial setup of the GORM CLI tool. It offers diagnostic tips and step-by-step solutions to quickly resolve problems related to Go environment, dependencies, CLI execution errors, and file generation.

---

## 1. Common Installation Issues

### 1.1 Go Version Mismatch

The GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** (to support generics). A mismatch or an older Go version often causes build or runtime failures.

**How to Verify Your Go Version:**

```bash
go version
```

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to Go 1.18+ by downloading from the official [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Ensure your `$PATH` points to the correct Go installation if multiple versions coexist.

<Tip>
Using an outdated Go version is the most frequent cause of install failures. Confirm your version before proceeding.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Missing Dependencies or Modules

Errors during `go install` or running the CLI may indicate missing Go modules or improper module setup.

**How to Diagnose:**
- Run `go mod tidy` inside your project to fetch missing dependencies.
- Check for network or proxy issues that block module downloads.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your project is a valid Go module with a `go.mod` file.
- Use `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` to install the CLI tool globally.
- If behind a corporate proxy or firewall, configure Go proxy variables accordingly.

<Note>
The CLI is distributed as a Go module and requires internet access for dependency resolution during installation.
</Note>

### 1.3 Command Not Found or CLI Execution Errors

If running `gorm` or `gorm gen` results in "command not found" or execution errors:

**Steps to Fix:**

1. Confirm the CLI binary is in your system's `$PATH`.

```bash
which gorm
```

2. If not found, ensure you installed with `go install` and your `$GOPATH/bin` or equivalent directory is included in `$PATH`.

3. On Windows, ensure the binary has `.exe` extension and your terminal can access the directory.

4. Try running the binary directly with its full path to check if the binary is functional.

---

### 1.4 Incorrect Input or Output Paths

The CLI requires correct paths to interface files and output directories.

**Symptoms:**
- Errors like `error processing <path>: file does not exist`
- Generated files missing or in unexpected directories

**How to Check:**
- Verify the input argument (`-i` or `--input`) points to the correct Go source file or directory containing your SQL-annotated interfaces.
- Confirm the output path (`-o` or `--output`) is a writable directory.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

**Tips:**
- Use relative or absolute paths consistently.
- If no `-o` flag is set, generated code goes to `./g` by default.

---

## 2. Verifying Installation and Setup

Confirm the GORM CLI is installed and runs correctly by:

1. Running the CLI help command to ensure it responds without error:

```bash
gorm --help
```

2. Running code generation on sample input:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./generated
```

3. Confirm that generated files appear in the output directory.

---

## 3. Troubleshooting Code Generation Failures

### 3.1 Parsing Errors on Interfaces

If you see parse errors referencing files or comments:

- Check that your interface methods have proper Go syntax.
- Ensure SQL templates in comments use supported DSL directives (e.g., `@@table`, `{{where}}`).
- Make sure method return signatures conform to GORM CLI expectations (e.g., last return being `error`).

### 3.2 Missing or Incorrect GenConfig

If certain interfaces or structs are unexpectedly omitted:

- Verify `genconfig.Config` declarations in your packages.
- Check includes and excludes patterns don’t unintentionally filter out your types.
- Remember that package-level configs are automatically applied based on file location and `FileLevel` settings.

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Not including required context.Context parameter:** The generator adds `ctx` automatically if missing, but including it explicitly aligns better with your project style.

- **Incorrect SQL template syntax:** Use supported directives exactly; incorrect or malformed templates cause generation failures.

- **Incorrect Go module setup:** Ensure your project is initialized as a Go module (`go mod init`) to avoid resolution issues.

- **Output directory permissions:** The CLI must have write access to the output path.

## 5. Getting Additional Help

- Consult the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/welcome-and-installation/installation) for detailed install steps.
- Review the [Basic Configuration Setup](/getting-started/first-steps/basic-configuration) for correct package organization.
- Use [Generating Your First Code](/getting-started/first-steps/generating-code) for comprehensive generation instructions.
- For issues during runtime, including API usage, see [Using the Generated APIs](/getting-started/first-steps/using-generated-apis).

<Tip>
Always ensure your Go toolchain and environment variables are set up cleanly before troubleshooting complex issues.

## Appendix: Quick Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check Go version
go version

# Check gorm binary location
which gorm

# Run CLI with help
gorm --help

# Run code generation with verbose/errors
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

# Check output files
ls ./generated
```
