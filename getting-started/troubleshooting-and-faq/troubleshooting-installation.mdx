# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide addresses common installation problems you may encounter when setting up GORM CLI. It empowers you to quickly identify and resolve issues like missing Go installations, incorrect environment paths, or version incompatibilities to ensure a smooth installation experience before seeking additional support.

---

## 1. Common Installation Pitfalls and Fixes

### 1.1 Go Not Installed or Not in PATH

GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or newer. If the `gorm` command is unrecognized or installation commands fail, verify your Go installation:

```bash
go version
```

**Expected output example:**
```
go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64
```

If Go is missing or the version is below 1.18:

- Install or upgrade Go to version 1.18 or later from https://golang.org/dl/
- Make sure the `go` binary is in your system's PATH environment variable.

#### Fix PATH issues

Add the Go binary directory to your PATH. For example, on Unix systems:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

On Windows, add the Go `bin` folder to your system environment variables.

<Tip>
Remember to restart your terminal or shell session after adjusting the PATH to ensure changes take effect.
</Tip>

### 1.2 `go install` Command Fails

When running the installation command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

If you see errors such as "module not found" or "cannot find module", check:

- Your Go environment is properly initialized.
- You have network connectivity to fetch modules.
- Your `GOPROXY` environment variable is set correctly or use the default proxy.

You can verify your Go environment settings with:

```bash
go env
```

<Tip>
If using private repositories for Go modules, ensure authentication methods are configured correctly.
</Tip>

---

### 1.3 `$GOPATH/bin` Not in PATH

After successful installation, the `gorm` executable will reside in `$GOPATH/bin` (by default, usually `~/go/bin`). If your shell can't find the GORM CLI command after install, verify:

1. Your `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your PATH.
2. Confirm the executable exists:

```bash
ls $GOPATH/bin/gorm
# or
which gorm
```

If missing, add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or equivalent
```

---

### 1.4 Incompatible Go Version

GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in Go 1.18. If attempting with an older Go version, you’ll encounter errors.

Check Go version explicitly:

```bash
go version
```

If below 1.18, update Go to a compatible version.

---

### 1.5 Insufficient Permissions

Some environments may restrict writing to `$GOPATH/bin` or installing binaries globally.

- Run installation commands without `sudo` to avoid permission conflicts.
- If permission denied errors occur, consider adjusting directory permissions or installing Go in a user-writable directory.

---

## 2. Validation and Verification

After installation, validate by running:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output shows usage instructions for GORM CLI, confirming the tool is installed and accessible.

Next, try generating your first code:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

See [Validating Your Installation](../setup-and-installation/first-run-validation) for a detailed walkthrough.
