# Installing GORM CLI

This guide provides you with clear, step-by-step instructions to install GORM CLI quickly and reliably on your development environment. GORM CLI is a powerful tool that generates type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-based field helpers for Go projects using GORM. Follow these instructions to get the tool installed and ready for generating your first GORM query code.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Go Version:** Go 1.18 or newer is required, as GORM CLI utilizes Go generics.
- **Supported Platforms:** The installation process works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
- **Go Toolchain:** The Go toolchain needs to be installed and accessible in your system PATH.
- **GORM Library:** While not strictly necessary to install before GORM CLI, your Go project should be set up to use `gorm.io/gorm` to leverage the generated code properly.

<Check>
Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Ensure it shows version 1.18 or above.
</Check>

## 2. Installation Instructions

Follow the relevant steps below depending on your operating system.

### Installing via `go install`

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module and can be installed using the standard Go install command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command fetches the latest stable version and installs the `gorm` binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` or Go bin directory.

### Setting Up Your PATH

After installation, ensure the Go binaries directory is included in your system PATH so that you can invoke the `gorm` command globally:

- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
  ```

  Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence.

- **Windows:**

  Add `%GOPATH%\bin` to your system environment PATH variable via the system settings.

<Warning>
If after installation you cannot invoke `gorm` from your terminal, double-check your PATH settings and restart your terminal session.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Verifying Installation

Once installed, confirm that the CLI is available and working:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the help output describing available commands such as `gen` for code generation.

---

## 4. Platform-Specific Notes & Best Practices

- **Windows Users:** Use PowerShell or Command Prompt with administrator privileges to install and adjust PATH as needed.
- **macOS/Linux Users:** You may use `sudo` if encountering permission errors.
- **Go Module Compatible Projects:** GORM CLI integrates smoothly with Go modules; ensure your project uses modules (`go.mod`) for best experience.

<Info>
If you wish to install a specific version rather than the latest, replace `@latest` in the `go install` command with the desired version tag.
</Info>

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

Encountering problems is common. Use the following tips to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Command not found after installation">
- Confirm `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH environment variable.
- Restart your terminal or IDE.
- Verify installation location with:

  ```bash
  ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gorm
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go version too low">
- Upgrade to Go 1.18 or later.
- Download and install the latest Go distribution from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
- Confirm installation:

  ```bash
go version
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied during installation">
- Use elevated permissions (`sudo` on Unix/Linux/macOS).
- Check writable permissions on `$GOPATH/bin`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network issues during go install">
- Ensure you have internet connectivity.
- Verify you can access `gorm.io` modules.
- Use VPN or adjust firewall settings if necessary.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

After successful installation, proceed to:

- Define your Go interfaces with SQL templates and your model structs.
- Run the code generator using the `gorm gen` command to create type-safe query APIs and field helpers. For example:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./generated
```

- Consult [First Run & Quick Validation](/getting-started/setup-intro/first-run-validate) to verify your setup integrity.

- Explore advanced configuration options and best practices in configuring generation.
