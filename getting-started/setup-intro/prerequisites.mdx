# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following requirements before installing and using GORM CLI. Completing these prerequisites guarantees a smooth and successful setup.

---

## 1. Go Version Requirement

- **Minimum Go Version:** 1.18 or higher is mandatory.
- GORM CLI leverages Go's generics introduced in version 1.18 to provide type-safe query code generation.
- Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```


## 2. Platform Compatibility

- GORM CLI supports all major platforms where Go runs, including:
  - Linux (amd64, arm64)
  - macOS (amd64, arm64)
  - Windows (amd64)

- Ensure your platform supports Go 1.18+.


## 3. System Resources

- No specialized hardware requirements.
- Typical system resources should suffice:
  - Minimum 1GB RAM
  - At least 100 MB free disk space for binaries and generated code


## 4. Dependencies

GORM CLI depends primarily on Go tooling. Hereâ€™s what you need:

- **Go Toolchain:** Must be installed and in your system PATH.

- **GORM Library:**
  - Your project should already include `gorm.io/gorm` dependency.
  - GORM CLI generates code that integrates seamlessly with GORM.
  - You can add GORM to your project using:

    ```bash
    go get -u gorm.io/gorm
    ```

- **GORM CLI Tool Installation:**
  - Installed via `go install`.
  - Runs as a command-line tool.


## 5. Network Requirements

- No special networking setup required to run GORM CLI locally.
- Internet access is needed to install Go and fetch dependencies.


## 6. Access Requirements

- No special permissions or accounts are needed to run GORM CLI locally.
- Ensure your file system permissions allow writing generated code to your target output folder.


---

## Verification Checklist Before Installation

Run the following commands to confirm your environment is ready:

```bash
go version
which go
go env GOPATH
```

Make sure:

- `go version` reports version 1.18 or above.
- `go` command is available in your PATH.
- You have write access to your GOPATH or project directory.


---

<Tip>
Keeping Go up to date is crucial since GORM CLI relies on generics introduced in 1.18. Regularly check your Go version to avoid incompatible tool errors.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Attempting to use GORM CLI with Go versions earlier than 1.18 will fail with errors about generics or unsupported syntax.
</Warning>

---

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

### Problem: `go` command not found
- **Cause:** Go toolchain is not installed or not on system PATH.
- **Fix:** Install Go from https://golang.org/dl/ and ensure your PATH includes the Go bin directory.

### Problem: Go version below 1.18
- **Cause:** An older version of Go is installed.
- **Fix:** Upgrade to Go 1.18 or later.

### Problem: Permission denied writing generated code
- **Cause:** Insufficient filesystem permissions.
- **Fix:** Adjust permissions or run CLI with appropriate user privileges.


---

## Summary

Make sure you have Go 1.18+ installed and accessible on your system. Confirm your environment meets platform and resource expectations, and ensure your Go projects include GORM dependencies. With these prerequisites ready, you can move confidently to installing the GORM CLI tool and start generating type-safe query code efficiently.

## Appendix: Checking Your Go Environment

Run this script snippet to fully validate your local Go setup:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if ! command -v go &> /dev/null; then
  echo "Go is not installed or not in PATH."
  exit 1
fi

GOVERSION=$(go version | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/go//')

if [[ "$GOVERSION" < "1.18" ]]; then
  echo "Go version is below 1.18 ($GOVERSION). Please upgrade."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Go version $GOVERSION detected - meets requirement."

go env GOPATH
```

Use this command as a quick verification step before installation.
