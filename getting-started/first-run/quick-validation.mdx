# Validate Your First Generated Code

This guide helps you confirm that your generated GORM CLI APIs function correctly with simple validation queries against test databases. By following these steps, you will confidently verify your setup and the integrity of the generated code before integrating it further into your project.

---

## 1. Preparation: Ensure Generated Code is Ready

Before running validations, complete these prerequisites:

- You have generated code using `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./output/path`.
- Generated files exist in the output directory and have been imported into your Go project.
- Your database connection and models are set up for test queries.

<Tip>
If you have not generated code yet, see the [Quick Start: Generate and Use APIs](https://your-docs/getting-started/first-run/quickstart-sample) guide.
</Tip>

## 2. Validation Checklist and Sample Verification

Follow the steps below to execute specific queries and operations to confirm the generated APIs behave as expected.

### Step 1: Execute Basic Record Retrieval
Run a simple query using the generated Query interface to fetch a record by primary key.

```go
// Example assumes generated package is imported as 'generated'
import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/examples/generated"
  "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func validateGetByID(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1)
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("GetByID query failed: %w", err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("Retrieved User: %+v\n", user)
  return nil
}
```

**Success Criterion:** User struct with ID=1 is returned without errors.

### Step 2: Use Field Helpers to Filter Records
Test filtering records with generated model-driven field helpers.

```go
func validateFilterByAge(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  users, err := generated.G[User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
    Find(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("Filter by Age > 18 failed: %w", err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("Users with Age > 18: %d records\n", len(users))
  return nil
}
```

**Success Criterion:** Query completes successfully and returns a non-empty slice (if applicable).

### Step 3: Validate Update Operation with Field Setters
Confirm ability to perform updates using generated setters.

```go
func validateUpdateUserRole(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  rows, err := generated.G[User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")).
    Set(generated.User.Role.Set("active")).
    Update(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("Update operation failed: %w", err)
  }
  fmt.Printf("Rows updated: %d\n", rows)
  return nil
}
```

**Success Criterion:** Update completes with expected affected rows count.

### Step 4: Verify Association Helpers (Optional)
If your models include associations, test creating or modifying associated records through generated helpers.

```go
func validateCreateWithAssociation(db *gorm.DB) error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  err := generated.G[User](db).
    Set(
      generated.User.Name.Set("new_user"),
      generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
    ).
    Create(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("Create with association failed: %w", err)
  }
  fmt.Println("Created new user with pet association successfully")
  return nil
}
```

**Success Criterion:** Parent and associated child records are created and linked correctly.

## 3. Interpreting Validation Outcomes

- **Queries returning errors:** Confirm database connectivity, inspect generated code imports, and verify model/interface correctness.
- **Zero or unexpected results:** Ensure database seeded with test data matching your queries.
- **Compilation errors:** Check Go module import paths and regenerate code with proper configurations.

<Tip>
Use verbose logging or debugging to trace errors during validation steps. Logs from GORM and generated code help pinpoint issues.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Reviewing Generated Code for Deeper Confidence

For further assurance, examine your generated output files located in your configured output directory (e.g., `./generated`). They include:

- **Query interface implementations:** Each method corresponds to the SQL templates from your interfaces.
- **Field helper structs:** These define typed fields with predicate and setter methods.

<Tip>
Example generated files and tests are available in the [examples/output](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli/tree/main/examples/output) directory of the official repository for reference.
</Tip>

## 5. Next Steps After Validation

Once you have successfully validated your generated code:

- Integrate the generated query APIs and field helpers into your application logic.
- Explore advanced filtering, updates, and associations as per your use cases.
- Customize the generation via `genconfig.Config` to suit project conventions.
- Refer to [Quick Start: Generate and Use APIs](https://your-docs/getting-started/first-run/quickstart-sample) and [Configuration and Customization](https://your-docs/getting-started/first-run/configuration-setup) guides.
