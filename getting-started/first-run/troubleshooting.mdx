# Troubleshooting & Common Issues

When using GORM CLI for the first time or integrating it into your project, you may encounter some common issues or unexpected behaviors. This guide provides practical solutions, diagnostic steps, and tips to help you resolve setup, configuration, and generation problems quickly so that you stay productive.

## Installation and Environment Issues

### Problem: `gorm` CLI command not found or not executing

- **Cause**: The CLI binary is not installed properly or your system PATH does not include the Go bin directory.

- **Solution:**
  1. Verify Go is installed and version 1.18 or newer:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

  2. Install the GORM CLI:

  ```bash
  go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```

  3. Confirm your environment PATH includes `$GOPATH/bin` or Go's bin directory;  
     e.g., add the following to your shell profile:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

  4. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` / `source ~/.zshrc`.

  5. Test CLI accessibility:

  ```bash
  gorm --help
  ```

  This should display usage information.

### Problem: Permission denied or binary execution errors

- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions on the installed binary or incompatible OS/architecture.

- **Solution:**
  - Check the binary permissions (`ls -l $(which gorm)`) and ensure execute rights.
  - Reinstall the CLI for your platform.
  - Confirm your Go environment targets your OS/architecture.

### Common Pitfalls

- Installing on Go versions less than 1.18 leads to incompatible builds.
- Running CLI from system shell without installed binary.
- PATH not updated after installation.

## Generator Command Failures

### Problem: `gorm gen` fails with `error processing` or file parse errors

- **Diagnosis:** The CLI cannot parse the input Go interface files due to syntax errors, missing files, or unsupported constructs.

- **Steps to Fix:**

  1. Confirm the `--input` path points to a valid Go source file or directory containing interface definitions.

  2. Check for Go compilation errors or malformed code in your interface files.

  3. Avoid including files generated by other tools or binaries; these are skipped by default but can cause unexpected issues if altered.

  4. Use `go build` or `go vet` on your source files to detect syntax issues early.

  5. Look for descriptive error messages from the CLI indicating problematic files or code.

### Problem: Required `--input` flag missing

- The `gen` command requires `--input` to specify the source to process.

- Example usage:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./interfaces -o ./generated
```

- Missing or incorrect path results in an error.

### Problem: Output directory permission or creation errors

- Verify that the path given in `--output` exists or can be created.
- The CLI attempts to create directories as needed, but filesystem permissions may prevent this.

- Fix by adjusting permissions or choosing a writable directory.

---

## Configuration and Filtering Issues

### Problem: Generated code missing expected interfaces or structs

- **Cause:** Package-level `genconfig.Config` filtering excludes some interfaces or structs.

- **Resolution:**
  - Review any `genconfig.Config` declarations in your packages that use `Include*` or `Exclude*` filters.
  - Remember that `Include*` takes precedence over `Exclude*`.
  - Wildcard patterns (e.g., `Query*`) are supported but must match names correctly.

- Example filter adjustment:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  ExcludeInterfaces: []any{"Deprecated*"},
}
```

- If your interface is excluded unexpectedly, relax or correct the filters.

### Problem: Output path is always `./g` (default) instead of configured path

- If you declare `OutPath` in `genconfig.Config`, note that package-level configs override the default output directory.
- The output path for a file is determined by the generator scanning applicable configs hierarchically.
- Check that your config is in the correct package and properly recognized.

## Template Parsing and SQL Generation Errors

### Problem: `panic: finish method must return at least one value` during generation

- **Cause:** Interface methods with SQL templates must have a return value (last value is `error`).

- **Fix:** Ensure all interface methods that contain SQL raw templates return at least one result type and an error.

- Example correct signature for a method returning data:

```go
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

- If no results are returned, the method must at least return `error`.

### Problem: Complex SQL templates causing generation errors

- Review the SQL templating in comments for correctness, especially '{{where}}', '{{set}}', `@@table` placeholders, and `@param` bindings.
- Common mistakes include:
  - Missing SQL comment syntax (`//`) per method.
  - Incorrect or missing parameter names.
  - Mismatched return types for method signatures.

- Use samples like `examples/query.go` as reference.

## Unexpected Output or Missing Generated Files

### Problem: No files are generated even though the `gen` command runs without errors

- Check if all interfaces and structs were filtered out by configuration.
- The CLI skips files/packages that yield no interfaces or structs after include/exclude filters.
- Enable verbose logging by temporarily adding print statements or check command output for "Skipping generated file" messages.

### Problem: Generated code fails to build

- The generated code should be valid Go and formatted automatically.
- Ensure external dependencies like GORM (`gorm.io/gorm`) are installed in your module and accessible.
- Run `go mod tidy` to fix missing dependencies.

---

## Common Best Practices and Tips

- **Use explicit `--input` paths:** Avoid ambiguous inputs that include unwanted files.
- **Apply clear configuration:** Use `genconfig.Config` to control generation scope and output path logically.
- **Keep interface method comments clean:** Write SQL templates clearly in the exact format.
- **Test generation incrementally:** Start with a minimal interface then expand.
- **Run Go analyzers:** Use `go vet` or `golint` on interfaces and models before generation.
- **Check permissions on output directories:** Especially when generating in protected folders.

## Where to Get Help

- Explore the GORM CLI [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) for issues and discussions.
- Consult detailed guides under Getting Started and Guides tabs in the official documentation.
- Review example projects within the repository, especially `examples/query.go`.
- Reach out on GORM community forums or Slack channels.
