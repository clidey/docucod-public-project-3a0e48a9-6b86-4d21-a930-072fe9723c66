# Troubleshooting Your First Run

When starting with GORM CLI, encountering issues during installation, configuration, or code generation is common. This guide helps you diagnose and resolve frequent problems so you can quickly resume your development workflow.

---

## 1. Common Setup Issues

### 1.1 Missing or Incorrect Go Version

**Problem:** GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or higher due to generics support.

**How to check:**
```bash
go version
```

**Solution:**
- If your Go version is older than 1.18, update to the latest stable release.
- Ensure your system PATH points to the correct Go binary.

<Note>
Using Go versions below 1.18 will cause build and generation failures due to missing generics.
</Note>

---

### 1.2 GORM CLI Not Found or Not Executable

**Problem:** After installation, typing `gorm` or `gorm gen` returns "command not found".

**How to check:**
```bash
gorm version
# or
which gorm
```

**Solution:**
- Confirm `$GOPATH/bin` or the Go install bin directory is in your system PATH.
- Reinstall with:
  ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
  ```
- Restart your terminal to reload PATH changes.

<Warning>
Avoid manual copying of binaries; always use `go install` for compatibility and updates.
</Warning>

## 2. Troubleshooting Code Generation Failures

### 2.1 Input Interface File Missing or Incorrect

**Problem:** Running `gorm gen -i path/to/file.go` fails with "file not found" or parsing errors.

**Check:**
- Verify the input file path points to a Go file containing properly defined interfaces.
- The interface file must include SQL template comments as per GORM CLI requirements.
- The file should compile on its own without syntax errors.

### 2.2 Output Directory Issues

**Problem:** Generated code not appearing, or write permission errors.

**Solution:**
- Confirm you have write permissions to the output directory.
- Use the `-o` flag to specify a valid directory, e.g.: 
  ```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./examples/output
  ```
- If the directory does not exist, create it prior to generation.

### 2.3 Generation Errors About Missing Packages or Imports

**Problem:** Errors related to unresolved packages, imports, or models.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your project dependencies are installed and up to date.
- Your interfaces and models should import relevant packages correctly.
- Resolve missing or circular imports prior to generation.

<Info>
Running `go mod tidy` can often fix unresolved import issues:
```bash
go mod tidy
```
</Info>

## 3. Debugging Failed Queries and Generated Code

### 3.1 Enable Verbose Debug Output

To track what SQL queries or generation steps are performed:

```bash
export DEBUG=true
# or
set DEBUG=true # windows
```

Then re-run your CLI commands or tests. This will produce detailed logs for inspection.

### 3.2 Inspect Generated Files Manually

After running `gorm gen`, check the output directory for generated Go files.
- Make sure interfaces have corresponding implementations.
- Review generated code for unexpected omissions or errors.

### 3.3 Common Code Issues

- **Missing context.Context parameters:** GORM CLI automatically injects context in generated methods, so your interfaces need not declare them.
- **Template syntax errors:** Verify your SQL templates in interface comments use correct tokens (`@@table`, `{{where}}`, etc.) and proper Go templating syntax.

---

## 4. Example: Troubleshooting a Code Generation Failure

Assume you run:
```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples/query.go -o ./examples/output
```

- **Step 1:** Confirm `./examples/query.go` exists and includes query interfaces with SQL templates.
- **Step 2:** Check `OutPath` in any `genconfig.Config` in the package overrides `-o` flag.
- **Step 3:** If generation fails, run with `DEBUG=true` environment variable to see detailed error output.
- **Step 4:** Look for specific errors about imports or unknown types and fix them in your Go source files.

---

## 5. Fixing Path and Environment Issues

- Always use absolute or correct relative paths relative to your project's root directory.
- Avoid running generation commands from arbitrary directories unless paths are absolute.
- Confirm the Go module (`go.mod`) is properly configured.

---

## 6. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Seed your test database carefully:** Use helper functions like `seedUsers()` in tests to ensure consistent data, preventing query edge cases.
- **Keep interfaces and models together:** This reduces path and import confusion.
- **Use config files (`genconfig.Config`) for special cases:** Customize type mappings, output paths, and inclusions/exclusions to avoid unwanted generation errors.
- **Check for Go build errors beforehand:** Make sure `go build ./...` passes to avoid cascading CLI problems.

## 7. Where to Get Help

- Refer to [Writing Your First Query Interface and Model](getting-started/first-use-configuration/writing-query-interfaces-and-models) for interface patterns.
- Use [Generating Code](getting-started/first-use-configuration/generating-code) for detailed command usage.
- See [Using Generated APIs](getting-started/first-use-configuration/using-generated-apis) to verify your outputs.
- Join Go and GORM communities for support if problems persist.
