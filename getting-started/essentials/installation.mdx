# Installing GORM CLI

Step-by-step instructions to install GORM CLI on your system using Go's package management. This guide covers installation on common platforms and how to verify a successful setup.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your system meets the following:

- **Go Version**: Requires Go 1.18 or later due to generics support.
- **Environment**: GOPATH and PATH must be properly set up so `go install` commands work and the binary is accessible.
- **Network Access**: Internet connection to download packages from `gorm.io` module.

If you haven’t installed Go or are unsure about your Go environment, refer to official [Go Installation Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).

<Tip>
Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` directory is included in your system's PATH environment variable so you can run `gorm` from any terminal.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installing GORM CLI

GORM CLI is distributed as a Go module. The recommended installation method uses the `go install` command.

### Installation Command

Open your terminal and run the following:

```bash
# Install the latest version of GORM CLI
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads the required source code, compiles the CLI tool, and places the executable in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

### Platform Considerations

- **Linux/macOS:**
  - Ensure Go is installed and GOPATH/bin is in your PATH.
  - If `gorm` is not recognized after install, check `$HOME/go/bin` for the binary.

- **Windows:**
  - Confirm that `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` is in your system PATH.
  - Run PowerShell or CMD as administrator if you face permission issues.

### Alternative: Installing a Specific Version

If you need a specific GORM CLI version instead of the latest, specify its version tag:

```bash
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v0.3.0
```

Replace `v0.3.0` with the desired released version.

---

## 3. Verifying the Installation

After installation, confirm that GORM CLI is installed and accessible:

```bash
gorm --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
GORM CLI version x.y.z
```

If the command is not found:

- Verify that your `$GOPATH/bin` (`$HOME/go/bin` by default) is in your PATH.
- Check if the installation command produced any errors.

<Tip>
If you used a custom GOPATH, ensure it matches your environment, or explicitly add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to your PATH.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Running Your First Command

Once installed, you can run GORM CLI commands.

Example: Display usage information for the `gen` command that generates code:

```bash
gorm gen --help
```

This displays flags and usage instructions for the code generation command.

<Tip>
Start with the `gen` subcommand after installation. It requires the input file path (-i) containing your Go interfaces with SQL template comments.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Installation Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
If running `gorm` reports `command not found`:

- Confirm the executable exists in your Go bin directory by running `ls $(go env GOPATH)/bin | grep gorm`.
- Add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to your PATH environment variable.
- Restart your terminal after updating PATH.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied or Installation Fails">
- Run your terminal or shell as administrator or with appropriate permissions.
- Check if your Go installation path is writable.
- On Windows, try PowerShell with administrator privileges.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low or Missing">
- Confirm your Go version with `go version`.
- Update Go to version 1.18 or newer to support generics.
- Follow the official Go upgrade guide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network/Binary Download Failures">
- Check your internet connectivity.
- Verify proxy settings if behind a corporate firewall.
- Retry the installation command.
</Accordion>

**Example: Installing and verifying on macOS/Linux**

```bash
# Install GORM CLI
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Confirm path
 export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH

# Verify installed version
 gorm --version
```

**Example: Installing and verifying on Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
# Install GORM CLI
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest

# Add Go bin to PATH if needed
 $env:PATH += ";" + (go env GOPATH) + "\bin"

# Check version
 gorm --version
```

<Tip>
If you plan to run the generator often, consider adding the Go bin folder permanently to your environment variables.
</Tip>
