# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your environment is properly prepared before installing and using GORM CLI. These requirements cover everything from the supported Go versions to package dependencies, ensuring smooth installation and operation.

---

## 1. Required Go Version

- **Minimum Go Version:** Go 1.18 or newer is required.
  - GORM CLI depends on Go generics, introduced in Go 1.18, for type-safe query API generation.
- Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

Upgrade your Go installation if the version is older than 1.18.

---

## 2. Basic Package Dependencies

GORM CLI works with projects that use:

- **`gorm.io/gorm`**: The GORM ORM package for Go.
- **`gorm.io/cli/gorm`**: The CLI tool package itself.

Ensure your project already includes GORM v2 setup because GORM CLI generates code that builds on top of GORM’s existing APIs.

### Installation of GORM CLI Tool

Install the CLI globally with:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Ensure your `GOPATH/bin` is in your system’s PATH to access `gorm` command directly.

---

## 3. Project Layout and Source Files

- Your Go project should be organized into packages where models and SQL-annotated query interfaces reside together or in the same directory.
- Annotate Go interfaces with SQL templates as comments for automatic code generation.
  - Example interfaces use generic type parameters to generate type-safe query methods.

---

## 4. Optional but Recommended

### SQL Drivers and Database Setup

- Ensure your database drivers for GORM are installed and configured if you intend to run integration tests or verify generated code behavior interacting with a database.

### Configuration File (Optional)

- You can define a `genconfig.Config` in the package to customize generation behavior (output path, include/exclude filters, custom field mappings).

Example excerpt:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "./generated",
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
}
```

This config file is automatically picked up during generation.

---

## 5. Network and System Requirements

- No special network ports or firewall configurations are necessary as GORM CLI is a local command-line tool working on your source files.
- Disk space depends on your project size; typically, a few megabytes are sufficient for generated code.

---

## 6. Verification of Environment

To confirm your system is ready:

1. Check Go version:

```bash
go version
```

You should see `go version go1.18` or higher.

2. Verify GORM CLI installation:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see the CLI usage information including the `gen` command.

3. Confirm your project imports GORM properly and that your Go modules are tidy:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

---

## Troubleshooting Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
Ensure you have Go 1.18 or above. Older versions will cause generation failures related to generics.

Upgrade by downloading from the official Go site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GORM CLI Command Not Found">
Make sure you installed the CLI with `go install` and that `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` is in your PATH environment variable.

On Unix-like systems:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

On Windows, add `%GOPATH%\bin` to the system PATH.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Module Dependencies Missing">
Run `go mod tidy` to fetch all dependencies specified in your imports.

Ensure your project uses Go modules (presence of `go.mod` file).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

By meeting these system requirements and setting up your environment as outlined, you will be well-prepared to install GORM CLI, configure your project, and generate type-safe query code efficiently.

Next, proceed to the [Installing GORM CLI](../essentials/installation) guide for concrete instructions on installing the CLI tool and running your first code generation.
