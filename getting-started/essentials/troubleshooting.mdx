# Troubleshooting & Common Issues

Diagnosing and resolving common setup and runtime issues is key to a smooth experience with GORM CLI. This guide helps you identify frequent pitfalls such as missing Go installations, incorrect paths, unresolved dependencies, and failed code generations. It provides actionable steps, tips, and recovery options to fix problems encountered during your first usage and ongoing development.

---

## 1. Prerequisite Checks

Before attempting code generation or using GORM CLI, verify your environment meets these requirements.

### 1.1 Go Version
- Ensure Go version 1.18 or higher is installed as generics support is required.
  - Run:
  ```bash
  go version
  ```
  - Expected output should be something like `go version go1.18 ...` or higher.

### 1.2 Go Workspace
- Confirm your Go module environment is properly initialized.
  - You should be working inside a Go module (`go.mod` file exists).
  - Run:
  ```bash
  go mod tidy
  ```
  to verify all dependencies are resolved.

### 1.3 GORM CLI Installation
- Validate that the GORM CLI tool is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
  - Run:
  ```bash
  gorm --help
  ```
  - You should see a help summary listing commands such as `gen`.

<Tip>
If `gorm` command is not found, re-install with:
```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

Check your `GOPATH/bin` or `GOBIN` is included in your system PATH.
</Tip>

## 2. Common Errors During Code Generation

When running the generation command, typical errors may arise. Here’s how to identify and fix them.

### 2.1 Incorrect Input Paths

**Error:** CLI reports cannot find input directory or files.

**Cause:** Path provided to `gorm gen` is wrong or does not contain expected Go files.

**Solution:**
- Verify the relative or absolute path you pass to `gorm gen -i <path>` matches your project structure.
- Confirm that the path contains Go source files with interfaces/models.

### 2.2 Missing Interfaces or Structs After Generation

**Error:** Generated code does not include expected query or struct helpers.

**Cause:** Generation filters exclude certain interfaces or structs.

**Solution:**
- Check if your `genconfig.Config` file (e.g., `examples/filters/pattern/config.go`) includes restrictive filters like `IncludeInterfaces` or `ExcludeStructs`.
- Ensure your interfaces and structs names match those patterns or adjust inclusion/exclusion accordingly.

### 2.3 Errors in Interface Method Definitions

**Error:** Panic or failure during generation referencing method return types or SQL templates.

**Cause:** Incorrect method signatures or SQL template usage.

**Solution:**
- All “finish” methods (with raw SQL) must return at least one value, last return value must be `error`.
- Methods returning two values must have `error` as the second.
- SQL templates must be correctly formatted with directives (e.g., `@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`).
- Refer to the [Interface-Driven Query APIs](https://gorm.io/docs/interface-driven-query-apis/) guide for correct patterns.

### 2.4 Go Imports and Package Path Issues

**Error:** Cannot resolve package imports or types.

**Cause:** Incorrect or missing package import path in your project.

**Solution:**
- Run `go mod tidy` to fix module dependencies.
- Ensure your packages have proper module paths and the import paths are set correctly in your Go files.
- Verify GORM CLI detects correct package paths by matching your project’s module hierarchy.

## 3. Runtime Failures Using Generated Code

After generation, you may encounter runtime errors when using generated APIs.

### 3.1 SQL Query Fails

**Error:** Generated query returns SQL syntax errors or incorrect bindings.

**Cause:** Parameter mismatch or template errors in interface method annotations.

**Solution:**
- Check that placeholders (`@param`) in SQL template comments match method parameters exactly by name and type.
- Avoid escape sequence errors, e.g., using literal `\@` to escape `@` in strings.
- Use simple templates first and gradually add complexity.

### 3.2 Missing Context Parameter in Methods

**Error:** Generated methods lack a `context.Context` parameter or fail to compile.

**Cause:** Interface methods miss `ctx context.Context` but GORM CLI injects it automatically unless explicitly declared.

**Solution:**
- Add `ctx context.Context` explicitly to interface methods for clarity.
- If omitted, the generator adds it silently; ensure your implementations accommodate it.

### 3.3 Field Helper Type Mismatch

**Error:** Field helpers generate wrong types or fail due to custom types.

**Cause:** Custom types not mapped or incorrectly configured.

**Solution:**
- Use `genconfig.Config` to map your custom Go types to field helper types using `FieldTypeMap` and `FieldNameMap`.
- For example, map `sql.NullTime` to `field.Time{}` in your config.
- Re-run generation after updating the config.

## 4. Debugging Tips and Best Practices

- Use verbose or debug flags (if available) during generation to get detailed logs.
- Start with minimal interfaces and models to isolate issues.
- Validate your SQL templates separately before embedding in comments.
- Avoid nested or complex template DSL constructs until basics work.
- Regularly run `go fmt` and `go vet` on your generated code for early diagnostics.

---

## 5. Recovery and Support

- If generation fails repeatedly, delete the output directory and regenerate fresh to avoid stale files.
- Review the CLI and Go toolchain versions for compatibility.
- Consult the [GORM CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) issues for known problems.
- For complex issues, isolate minimal reproducible examples and seek help via community forums or issue tracker.
