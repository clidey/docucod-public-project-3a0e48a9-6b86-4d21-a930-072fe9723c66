# Prerequisites & Installation

Prepare your environment for smooth installation and usage of the GORM CLI tool. This guide walks you through the necessary system requirements, dependencies, and step-by-step installation instructions tailored to your platform. By following these steps, you ensure your environment supports modern, type-safe Go code generation powered by GORM CLI.

---

## 1. System Requirements & Dependencies

### Go Version

- **Minimum required**: Go 1.18 or later.
- Reason: GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in Go 1.18 to support type-safe code generation.

Ensure your Go version is at least 1.18 by running:

```bash
go version
```

> If your version is older, please update Go before proceeding.

### Operating System & Platform

- The CLI supports installation on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) where Go can be installed.

### PATH Environment

- Make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` directory is included in your system's `PATH` to run installed binaries directly.

### Network Access

- Internet access is needed during installation to fetch the `gorm.io/cli/gorm` module from the public Go repository.

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Installing GORM CLI via `go install`

The simplest and recommended way to install the GORM CLI tool is through the `go install` command, which builds and installs the binary in your Go workspace.

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

**What this does:**

- Downloads the latest version of GORM CLI
- Compiles the binary
- Places it in `$GOPATH/bin/gorm`

### Verifying Installation

Confirm the CLI installed correctly by checking the version or help output:

```bash
gorm --help
```

Expected output includes usage instructions with commands like `gen` for code generation.

### Troubleshooting Installation

<Tip>
If `gorm` is not recognized after installation, verify that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system's `PATH`. For example, add this line to your shell profile:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Restart your terminal or source the profile for the changes to take effect.
</Tip>

## 3. Rationale Behind Requirements

### Why Go 1.18+?

- GORM CLI leverages Go generics for **type safety** and **compile-time validation** of generated code.
- Older Go versions lack generics support, making the CLI incompatible or less effective.

### Dependencies Management

- GORM CLI depends on the standard Go modules system, so no additional dependency managers are required.
- Your project should use Go Modules (`go.mod`) for seamless integration and version control.

## 4. Ensuring a Ready Environment

Follow these steps to prepare your machine:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Go Version">
Run:

```bash
go version
```

Confirm the output is version 1.18 or higher.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure Go Modules are Enabled">
Make sure you are using Go modules with your project:

```bash
go env GO111MODULE
```

It should print `on` or `auto` (default in Go 1.16+).
</Step>
<Step title="Set PATH for Go Binaries">
Append the `GOPATH/bin` to your PATH environment variable.

Example for Unix-like systems:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

</Step>
<Step title="Install GORM CLI">
Execute:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Installation">
Check the CLI is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

- Use PowerShell or Command Prompt.
- Adjust environment variables via System Settings or use PowerShell commands.
- Ensure your terminal session recognizes the updated PATH.

### macOS & Linux

- Modify shell profile files like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile` to include Go binaries in your PATH.

---

## 6. Summary and Next Steps

Once installation succeeds, you are ready to use the GORM CLI for generating type-safe query APIs and model helpers. Begin by:

1. Creating your Go interfaces and models.
2. Using the CLI `gen` command to generate code.

Refer next to the guide [Configuring the CLI](./configuring-cli) to tailor generation options.
