# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide helps you swiftly identify and resolve the most frequent issues encountered during GORM CLI setup and usage. Whether you face installation errors, misconfigured environments, or code generation failures, this page provides you clear diagnostics and actionable fixes.

---

## 1. Verifying Go Environment and Version

GORM CLI requires **Go 1.18 or higher** because of generics support. An unsupported version is the most common cause of installation and build failures.

### Steps to Verify Go Version

```bash
go version
```

**Expected output:**

```
go version go1.18 ...
```

If your Go version is lower than 1.18, update Go by following the official [Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).

<Tip>
Always restart your terminal session after Go installation to refresh environment variables.
</Tip>

### Common Error Example

```plaintext
cannot use generics syntax: requires Go 1.18
```

**Resolution:** Upgrade Go to version 1.18 or later.

---

## 2. Installation Problems

When running the installation command:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

### Common Issues

- **Go module proxy problems or connectivity issues:** 

  Ensure your environment has internet access and Go module proxy settings are correctly configured.

- **Go path setup errors:** 

  Make sure your `GOPATH/bin` is added to your system `PATH` so you can run the `gorm` CLI directly.

### Verification

Run:

```bash
gorm --help
```

If the CLI help message appears, the installation was successful.

<Warning>
If you get `command not found`, verify `GOPATH/bin` or Go's bin dir is in your PATH environment variable.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Common Configuration and Source File Issues

### Problem: Model or Interface Files Not Found

GORM CLI expects your query interfaces and model structs in accessible packages or directories specified in the generation command.

**Symptoms:**

- No output files generated
- Errors mentioning missing models or interfaces

### Quick Fix:

- Confirm your directory structure follows Go conventions.
- Use absolute or relative paths accurately in your CLI invocation, e.g.:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- Ensure interface files have method comments with SQL templates; otherwise, generation skips them.

### Problem: Generation Output is Empty or Missing Expected Files

- Check that your interfaces contain correctly formatted SQL template comments.
- Confirm `genconfig.Config` settings do not exclude the intended interfaces or structs.

<Tip>
Use verbose or debug flags if available to see which interfaces and structs are loaded.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Handling Dependency and Module Errors

GORM CLI depends on your Go project's modules correctly resolving dependencies including `gorm.io/gorm` and `github.com/spf13/cobra`.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

- Run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

- Verify your `go.mod` lists compatible versions.

- If you encounter errors about missing modules, clear your module cache:

```bash
go clean -modcache
```

---

## 5. Common CLI Execution Errors

### Error Example:

```plaintext
Error: failed to execute command: interface not found
```

**Cause:** GORM CLI could not locate the interface specified or defaults.

### Resolution:

- Use the `-i` flag to specify the input directory explicitly.
- Ensure interface files are in proper packages and compile without errors.
- Confirm interfaces have valid Go generic syntax (e.g., `interface[T any]`).

---

## 6. Debugging Generation Failures

If `gorm gen` runs but produces partial or malformed output:

- Confirm your SQL template comments are correctly formatted as per the DSL.
  - Check you use directives like `@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`, and `{{set}}` properly.
  - Avoid syntax errors such as missing closing directives.

- Review error messages printed by `gorm gen` for line numbers and method names to locate template issues.

- Example fix for `WHERE` clause issues:

```go
// Correct way
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

Incorrect:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=$1
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

## 7. Addressing Association Helper Problems

When generating or using association helpers (e.g., `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`), problems usually stem from:

- Missing or incorrect model relationships (tags like `gorm:"foreignKey:..."`).
- Interface or struct generation filters excluding those models.

### Solution:

- Verify your struct definitions fully declare associations.
- Check your `genconfig.Config` for unintended exclusions.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Output Directory Issues

If output files are not generated where expected:

- Confirm the `-o` output directory path is correct and writable.
- The directory will be created if missing, but verify permissions.
- If using `genconfig.Config.OutPath`, ensure it matches your CLI command or is correctly imported.

---

## 9. Useful Tips and Best Practices

- Always run tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```

to verify generated code compiles and behaves as expected.

- Start with a minimal interface and model setup, then expand complexity.

- Use version control to track config and generated code changes.

- Reference [Example Queries](../examples/query.go) and [Configurations](../examples/filters/twolevel/config.go) for correct patterns.

---

## 10. Where to Get Help

- Review the [Official GORM CLI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/go-gorm/cli) Issues for community Q&A.
- Consult the broader [GORM documentation](https://gorm.io) for ORM-related questions.
- Engage with the GORM community on forums and chat groups.
