# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GORM CLI

Ensure your system meets these requirements before installing and running GORM CLI. This guarantees a smooth setup and reliable operation for generating type-safe query APIs and model field helpers.

---

## 1. System Requirements

- **Operating System:**
  - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux environments where Go can be installed.

- **Go Version:**
  - Requires **Go 1.18** or higher to support generics, which are essential for GORM CLI's type-safe code generation.

- **Disk Space:**
  - Minimal disk space is needed; ensure at least 100MB free to accommodate Go toolchain and generated code.

- **Memory:**
  - At least 1GB RAM recommended for compiling and running Go tools efficiently.

## 2. Dependency Requirements

- **Go Toolchain Installed and Configured:**
  - Confirm Go installation by running:

    ```bash
    go version
    ```

  - The version must be 1.18 or newer.

- **Network Access:**
  - Required to fetch GORM CLI module and dependencies:

    ```bash
    go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
    ```

  - Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to `gorm.io` and `github.com`.

## 3. Access and Permissions

- **User Permissions:**
  - Install the CLI using a user account with permissions to write to the Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).
  - For installation system-wide, administrative privileges might be necessary.

- **Project Permissions:**
  - The CLI will generate code into your project directories; ensure write permissions for target output paths.

## 4. Environment Configuration

- **Go Environment Variables:**
  - `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT` should be configured according to your Go installation.
  - Your system `$PATH` should include your Go bin directories to run the installed CLI easily.

- **Firewall and Proxy:**
  - If your environment uses a firewall or proxy, configure it to allow Go module fetches to `gorm.io` and GitHub domains.

---

## Tips for Preparation

- Verify your Go setup before running GORM CLI.
- If behind a corporate proxy, test module downloads separately before installing the CLI.
- Use a separate Go workspace or module-enabled project directory to manage generated code cleanly.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
Run `go version` to check your installed version.

If it is less than 1.18, update Go by downloading the latest version from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Not Found in PATH">
If running `go version` returns command not found, add Go's bin directory to your PATH.

For example, on Linux/macOS add to your shell profile:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Restart your terminal session after.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Issues During Installation">
If `go install` fails due to network errors, check:

- Your internet connection
- Firewall or proxy settings
- Verify you can access https://gorm.io and https://github.com via browser

Temporarily disable firewalls or use VPN if necessary.
</Accordion>

## Verification Checklist Before Installation

<Check>
- Go 1.18+ installed and verified (`go version`)
- Network accessible for downloading modules
- User has write permission for installation directories
- Environment variables `$GOPATH` and `$PATH` configured correctly
</Check>
