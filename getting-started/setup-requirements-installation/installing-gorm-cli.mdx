# Installing GORM CLI

Step through clear instructions to install GORM CLI using Go's package manager. Includes platform-specific notes and versioning tips to prevent common setup issues.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing GORM CLI, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later is required. GORM CLI leverages Go generics introduced in Go 1.18.
- **Go Environment Setup**: Your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` should be configured correctly. The `go` command must be accessible from your terminal.
- **Network Access**: The installer fetches packages from `gorm.io` module proxy servers. Ensure your network or firewall allows outbound HTTPS traffic.

<Tip>
Verify your Go version by running:

```bash
go version
```

If your version is below 1.18, please update Go to a supported version before proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Steps

Installing GORM CLI is seamless via the standard Go package installation command.

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Run the following command to install the latest stable release:**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This command downloads the `gorm` CLI tool and installs it in your Go binary directory (`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

3. **Verify installation:**

```bash
gorm version
```

You should see the version output confirming `gorm` CLI is installed.

<Tip>
If `gorm` is not recognized as a command, ensure your Go binary directory is added to your system PATH. For example:

- On Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

- On Windows PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  $env:Path += ";$(go env GOPATH)\bin"
  ```
</Tip>

---

## 3. Platform Notes

- **Windows:** Use PowerShell or Command Prompt. Make sure to use backticks or escape characters if running multi-line commands.
- **macOS/Linux:** Use Bash or your preferred shell. Exporting PATH can be added to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

---

## 4. Versioning & Updating

- To install a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired semantic version tag (e.g., `v0.1.5`):

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@v0.1.5
```

- To update to the newest version later, simply re-run the `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest` command.

- Verify your installed version anytime with:

```bash
gorm version
```

## 5. Common Installation Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system PATH environment variable. Run:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Check if your Go bin directory appears. Add it if absent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Too Low">
Update Go to at least 1.18. Old Go versions lack generics support required by GORM CLI.

Download the latest Go from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Issues">
If you are behind a proxy or firewall, Go may fail downloading modules. Set appropriate `GOPROXY` environment variables or use a VPN.

Example:

```bash
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
Installation writes to Go's bin directory. On some systems, you may need elevated permissions or adjust directory ownership.

Avoid running as `root` unless necessary; try fixing permissions instead.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Verifying Installation Success

After installation, running `gorm` should output the CLI help and version information:

```bash
$ gorm
GORM CLI Tool

Usage:
  gorm [command]

Available Commands:
  gen         Generate GORM query code from raw SQL interfaces
  help        Help about any command

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gorm

Use "gorm [command] --help" for more information about a command.

$ gorm version
vX.Y.Z
```

If you can see this output, your installation is successful and ready for use.

## 7. Next Steps

- After installation, follow the [Quick Start: From Models to Queries](https://your-docs-link/overview/quickstart-features/quickstart-workflow) guide to write interfaces and generate your first type-safe query APIs.
- Configure your project and generation parameters using the [Basic Configuration](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/initial-configuration-and-first-use/basic-configuration) page.
- If you encounter issues, consult [Troubleshooting Installation & Validation](https://your-docs-link/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-common-issues/troubleshooting-install-validate).
