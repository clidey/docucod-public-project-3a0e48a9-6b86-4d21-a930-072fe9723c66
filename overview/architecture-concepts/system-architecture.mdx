# System Architecture Overview

## Visualizing GORM CLI's Architecture and Data Flow

Understanding how GORM CLI fits into your Go codebase and integrates with the GORM ecosystem is fundamental to unlocking its full potential. This overview presents a clear, actionable picture of the system architecture, highlighting the key components, workflows, and interactions that enable seamless code generation and type-safe data access.

Whether you are evaluating GORM CLI for the first time or deepening your mastery, this diagram-driven guide helps you grasp how various parts—the CLI tool, code generators, your model definitions and interfaces, configuration, and generated output—cooperate to deliver compile-time safety, productivity, and extensibility.

## Key Components and Their Roles

- **GORM CLI (Command Line Interface)**: This is your main entry point (`gorm` command), managing user inputs and orchestrating code generation tasks.
- **Generator Module (`gen` package)**: Core logic performing parsing of your Go interface files, extracting SQL templates, and producing ready-to-use Go code.
- **User Models & Interfaces**: Your existing Go structs that define data models and the interfaces annotated with SQL templates that describe queries.
- **Generation Configuration (`genconfig`)**: Optional, package-level config that tailors file output locations, type mappings, and inclusion/exclusion rules, enhancing customization.
- **Generated Code Artifacts**: The result of generation—type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers that tightly integrate with GORM.
- **GORM ORM (`gorm.io/gorm`)**: The runtime ORM framework your application uses, consuming the generated code to enable fluent, safe database operations.

### Explanation of Workflow

1. **Model & Interface Preparation**: You define your Go structs for your data and interfaces annotated with embedded SQL templates.

2. **Optional Configuration**: You can customize specific generation behaviors through `genconfig.Config` declarations in your source packages.

3. **CLI Invocation**: Running the `gorm gen` command triggers the CLI, which orchestrates command parsing and directs generation tasks.

4. **Code Generation Process**: The generator parses your source, analyzes interfaces and models, applies configurations, and generates strongly typed, fluent query APIs and field helpers.

5. **Result Integration**: The generated code plugs into your project’s codebase, leveraging the GORM ORM to provide elegant, safe data access with compile-time guarantees.

## Detailed Component Descriptions

### GORM CLI Tool
- **Purpose**: Entry command interface for users to invoke generation.
- **Technology**: Uses the `cobra` library for CLI management.
- **User Interaction**: You provide input path(s) to your Go interface files and optionally specify output directories.

### Generator Module (`internal/gen`)
- **Purpose**: Backbone of the transformation from annotated Go interfaces into production-ready code.
- **Functionality**:
  - Parses your source files using Go’s `ast` package.
  - Extracts raw SQL, `Where`, `Select`, and other templates.
  - Applies generation rules and any user configs.
  - Writes formatted Go files including query interfaces and field helper variables.

### User Models & Interfaces
- **Models**: Regular Go structs representing your database entities (e.g., `User`, `Pet`). 
- **Interfaces**: GORM CLI-specific interfaces with methods commented with SQL templates to define queries and commands.

### Configuration
- Located optionally within your source packages.
- Controls output paths, field type mapping, inclusion/exclusion rules for interfaces and structs.
- Enables fine-tuning of generation behavior, allowing targeted, efficient outputs.

### Generated Code
- **Query APIs**: Type-safe, interface-driven methods enable compile-time checking of SQL queries with fluent calls.
- **Field Helpers**: Model field wrappers simplify filtering, updating, and association operations using expressive code constructs.
- Integrates directly with GORM ORM calls like `db.Where()`, `db.Create()`, and more.

### GORM ORM
- The runtime library that executes the generated query methods.
- Provides core ORM features; GORM CLI complements it by adding compile-time safety and code generation.

## How This Architecture Benefits You

- **Seamless Integration**: Minimal friction where your handwritten models and queries become powerful, generated APIs.
- **Confidence Through Typing**: Catch SQL mismatches and API misuse early, improving code reliability.
- **Extensible Configuration**: Adapt to your project's needs with flexible config.
- **Productivity Boost**: Automate tedious boilerplate — focus on designing expressive query interfaces.
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Cleaner separation of query definition and execution logic.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- Place interface definitions with SQL templates and models in the same package or directory to simplify generation.
- Use `genconfig.Config` to control generation output paths — maintain tidy project folder structures.
- Define either interface-driven queries or rely on generated field helpers for robust filters and association management.
- Always run the CLI generation step after modifying your interfaces or models to keep generated code in sync.
- Leverage the generated APIs in place of raw GORM calls for better discoverability and compile-time validation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Generated Code Directory Is Empty">
Ensure you specify the `-i` input flag to point to your interface files and optionally `-o` for output. Check that your interfaces are properly annotated with SQL template comments.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Queries Fail to Build or Execute">
Verify that your SQL templates in interface method comments are valid. The DSL supports placeholders like `@@table`, `@param`, and conditional blocks. Run the generator after every edit of these templates.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom Types Not Handled Correctly">
Use `FieldTypeMap` and `FieldNameMap` in your configuration to map custom Go types to supported field helpers. This is essential for special types like `sql.NullTime` or JSON.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
