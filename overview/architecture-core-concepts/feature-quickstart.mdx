## Deep Dive Into Key Features

### 1. Type-Safe API Generation

GORM CLI transforms your annotated interfaces into fully typed query APIs. Method signatures reflect your SQL query’s parameters and expected results, providing immediate feedback from your Go compiler if usage does not match expectations.

**Example:**

```go
// Interface method annotated with SQL comment:
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}

// Generated usage:
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

*Benefit*: Avoid common SQL injection bugs and runtime errors by catching issues during compile time.

---

### 2. Support for Associations

Beyond simple fields, GORM CLI detects model relationships like has-many or many-to-many and generates specialized helpers to manage these links safely and fluently.

For example, association operations such as `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, and `Delete` allow precise control over related data.

**Example:**

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

*Benefit*: Manage complex relational data consistently while preserving type safety.

---

### 3. Template-Based Query Generation

Use a powerful templating DSL inside your interface method comments to build versatile SQL queries. Support for `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}}`, and `{{for}}` control flows enable dynamic SQL generation tailored to method parameters.

**Example:**

```go
// Embedded SQL template with conditionals
// {{where}}
//   {{if user.Age > 18}} age > 18 {{end}}
// {{end}}
FilterAdults(user User) ([]T, error)
```

This template gets compiled into efficient Go code that constructs the final SQL with correct parameter bindings.

*Benefit*: Write expressive queries that adapt to inputs, reducing boilerplate and improving maintainability.

---

### 4. Configuration and Customization

GORM CLI’s code generation respects package-level configurations through `genconfig.Config`. This lets you fine-tune the output directory, selectively include or exclude interfaces/structs, and customize how Go types or struct tags map to generated field helpers.

**Example:**

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "examples/output",
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
    "json": JSON{},
  },
}
```

*Benefit*: Adapt GORM CLI generation to fit your project layout, coding standards, and type conventions seamlessly.

## Where These Features Live in the Code

- **Core Generation Engine:** Located in `internal/gen/generator.go`, it parses your input Go files, extracts interfaces and structs, applies configs, and orchestrates code production.

- **Template Rendering:** `internal/gen/template.go` holds the Go text/template defining how interfaces and struct helpers are rendered to source files.

- **Configuration Parsing:** Integrated within `internal/gen/generator.go`, it processes package-level `genconfig.Config` declarations to influence generation scope and mapping.

- **Entry Point for CLI:** `internal/gen/gen.go` defines the CLI command `gorm gen` that triggers code generation with input and output flags.

---

## Real-World Impact: Why These Features Matter

By combining type safety, association management, expressive query templates, and flexible customization, GORM CLI helps Go developers avoid common pitfalls:

- **Prevent runtime query errors** with type-checked API methods.
- **Work confidently with complex database relations** through generated association helpers.
- **Write adaptable, concise SQL queries** embedded directly in interfaces.
- **Maintain clean project structure** with configurable generation paths and filters.

In a codebase where SQL queries and database models evolve frequently, these benefits compound to deliver safer, cleaner, and faster development cycles.
