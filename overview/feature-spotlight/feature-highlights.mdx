# Key Features at a Glance

Discover the headline capabilities of GORM CLI, your essential tool for generating fluent, type-safe query APIs and field helpers tailored for Go projects using the GORM ORM. This page provides a concise overview of the core features, their use cases, and why each matters to your development workflow.

## Interface-Driven Query APIs

At the heart of GORM CLI lies the power to generate interface-driven, type-safe query APIs from your own Go interface definitions.

- **What It Means for You:** Write clean interfaces with concise method signatures and SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI produces strongly-typed implementations ensuring compile-time safety and discoverability.
- **Primary Use:** Safely build and execute complex database queries without raw SQL strings scattered throughout your code.
- **User Scenario:** Imagine defining a `Query[T]` interface with methods like `GetByID(id int) (T, error)` or `FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)` — the generated concrete implementations give you fully typed, rolling SQL queries integrated right into your Go code.

## Model-Driven Field Helpers

From your Go model structs, GORM CLI automatically generates model-driven field helpers for fields and associations.

- **What It Means for You:** Avoid tedious boilerplate while gaining an expressive, fluent API to create predicates and updates.
- **Primary Use:** Easily perform CRUD operations and filter queries using generated fields with methods like `.Eq()`, `.Gt()`, `.Set()`, `.Incr()`, and more.
- **User Scenario:** For a `User` model, use `generated.User.Age.Gt(18)` to filter users over 18 or `generated.User.Name.Set('alice')` to update the name field safely.

## Association Helpers

Handle complex relationships with explicit support for associations including has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many.

- **What It Means for You:** Manage related records with type-safe methods for creation, batch operations, unlinking, and deleting — all aware of the association type.
- **Primary Use:** Write safer code when linking or unlinking associated entities without direct foreign key manipulation.
- **User Scenario:** Create a user and simultaneously add pets or languages using helpers like `.Create()`, `.CreateInBatch()`, `.Unlink()`, or `.Delete()` on association fields such as `generated.User.Pets` or `generated.User.Languages`.

## Powerful SQL Templating

Leverage a robust, template-based SQL DSL embedded right in your interface method comments.

- **What It Means for You:** Express dynamic queries with familiar templating constructs (`{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}}`, `{{for}}`) that bind your Go parameters to SQL safely.
- **Primary Use:** Write maintainable, complex SQL statements with conditional logic and iteration without losing type safety.
- **User Scenario:** A method implementing an update with dynamic SET clauses lets you omit zero values and include conditional updates, reducing redundant query code.

## High-Level Advantages

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Catch errors early with strongly typed method parameters and return values.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** No need to handwrite repetitive query or update code.
- **Fluent & Expressive API:** Intuitive chaining and helper methods improve productivity.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Fit generated code smoothly into GORM workflows.
- **Configurable:** Customize generation output and field mappings through `genconfig.Config`.

## Real-World Example: From Interface to Generated Use

```go
// Define an interface with SQL templates
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)

// Generated type-safe usage in your application
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
  // handle error
}
```

```go
// Use generated model-driven field helpers
err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(21)).
  Set(generated.User.Name.Set("alice"), generated.User.IsAdult.Set(true)).
  Update(ctx)
```

```go
// Manage associations safely
err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
    generated.User.Languages.CreateInBatch([]models.Language{{Code: "EN"}, {Code: "FR"}}),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Keep Interfaces Small:** Define clear, reusable query interfaces focusing on specific tasks.
- **Use `genconfig.Config` for Customization:** Leverage config to tailor output paths, include/exclude patterns, and custom field mappings (e.g., JSON fields).
- **Write Clear SQL Templates:** Use the provided template syntax effectively to avoid runtime errors.
- **Leverage Association Helpers:** Prefer association helpers over manual foreign key handling for safer operations.

<Warning>
Avoid mixing raw SQL with generated APIs for performance-critical sections without type safety; use generated helpers to maintain consistency.
</Warning>
