# Target Audience & Key Use Cases

GORM CLI is designed with Go developers in mind who seek robust, maintainable, and type-safe data access code when working with GORM. Whether you're crafting complex queries, evolving your data layer safely, or integrating with an existing GORM application, GORM CLI offers powerful generation tools that transform your development workflow.

---

## Who Benefits Most from GORM CLI?

- **Go Developers Working with GORM:** Gain compile-time safety and reduce runtime errors by generating fluent, type-safe APIs directly from your model and query interfaces.

- **Teams Seeking Consistency Across Projects:** Ensure uniform query standards and data access patterns across multiple developers and codebases by generating consistent query and field helper methods.

- **Projects Requiring Maintainable Data Layers:** Simplify the evolution of your data access code by leveraging interface-driven, template-based generation, making refactors safer and more predictable.

---

## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Rapid Query API Prototyping

Imagine you need to prototype queries quickly for your application without writing boilerplate code. With GORM CLI, you define your query interfaces as Go interfaces with SQL templates in comments. The CLI generates concrete, type-safe implementations that you can immediately use. This lets you test and iterate on queries rapidly while ensuring correctness.

**Example:**

```go
// In your query interface file
// SQL: SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)
```

Generating with `gorm gen -i ./your_package -o ./generated` spawns disciplined query methods you can use directly.

### 2. Safe and Maintainable Data Layer Evolution

As your project grows, manual query and data manipulation code tends to become error-prone and hard to maintain. GORM CLI gives you a single source of truth for your database interactions — annotated interfaces and model structs — and keeps your data access layer synchronized through code generation.

This approach minimizes human error, enforces consistent query patterns, and integrates seamlessly with existing GORM operations.

### 3. Integration with Established GORM Applications

Already have a GORM-based project? GORM CLI complements and extends your setup by generating strongly typed helpers from your existing model structs, including fields and associations. These helpers enable fluent, discoverable, and safe update and association operations.

For example, you can update a user's pets or manage many-to-many relations with languages using generated APIs without manually writing complex GORM queries.

---

## Real-World Scenarios

- **Developers prototyping queries:** Quickly scaffold query methods for filters, updates, and batch operations.

- **Teams enforcing type safety:** Prevent SQL injection and common runtime errors by generating compile-time checked query methods.

- **Large projects handling complex relationships:** Manage has-many, belongs-to, and polymorphic associations safely with generated field helpers.

- **Continuous refactoring cycles:** Update your data access interfaces and models confidently, then regenerate code to reflect those changes uniformly.

## How This Page Fits in the Documentation

This page clarifies who should adopt GORM CLI and why, linking back to the foundational understanding in [What is GORM CLI?](../intro-value-core/what-is-gorm-cli) and the product's unique strengths detailed in [Value Proposition & Unique Features](../intro-value-core/value-proposition-and-unique-features). It prepares users to explore core patterns by illustrating how GORM CLI naturally fits into their Go projects.

---

### Practical Tips

- If you're working on a new GORM project or adding queries to an existing one, start by defining SQL-template interfaces to express your data retrieval logic.

- For projects with evolving data models, run the generator frequently to keep your APIs in sync and avoid brittle hand-written queries.

- Use the generated field helpers to manage associations instead of writing raw GORM code; this improves readability and reduces bugs.

- Combine the CLI with your IDE's autocomplete and type-checking to speed up development and reduce guesswork.

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping proper interface and model definitions:** The generator depends on well-structured interfaces and models. Incomplete or inconsistent definitions lead to incomplete or confusing generated code.

- **Ignoring generated code placement:** Keep generated code separate (e.g., an `/generated` folder) to avoid conflicts with handwritten implementation.

- **Over-relying on generated code without review:** While powerful, generated code is best used as a baseline. Review output to ensure it suits your query and association needs.

### Next Steps

Ready to harness the power of GORM CLI? Explore the [Quickstart: Generate Type-Safe APIs](../../guides/getting-started/quickstart-workflow) to start defining interfaces and generating code immediately.

## Example User Flow

1. **Define your query interface** with SQL templates.
2. **Run the GORM CLI generator** to produce type-safe APIs and field helpers.
3. **Use generated methods** in your application for queries, updates, and association handling.
4. **Iterate and evolve** interfaces/models as your data evolves, regenerating code as needed.

This flow simplifies many typical pain points in database code maintenance and accelerates development velocity.
