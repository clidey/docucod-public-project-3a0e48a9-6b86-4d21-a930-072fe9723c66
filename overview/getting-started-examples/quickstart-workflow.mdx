# Quickstart Workflow

Unlock the power of GORM CLI by following this streamlined workflow: writing your query interfaces and model structs, running the CLI generator to produce type-safe APIs and helpers, and smoothly adopting these generated APIs in your real codebase. This page walks you through each essential step with practical code snippets and command examples to get you up and running quickly and confidently.

---

## Why This Workflow Matters

Imagine turning your raw SQL queries and Go models into type-safe, fluent APIs that catch errors at compile time and dramatically reduce boilerplate. The Quickstart Workflow captures exactly that transformation, ensuring you write less repetitive code and gain discoverable, maintainable query methods tailored to your domain.

---

## Step 1: Write Your Query Interfaces and Model Structs

Start by defining your query interfaces with embedded SQL templates alongside your Go model structs.

### Define Your Model Struct

Models are your data representations reflecting database tables.

```go
// examples/models/user.go
package models

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

### Define Your Query Interface

Write an interface with methods documented by SQL-like template comments. These templates map your method parameters to safe, parameterized queries.

```go
// examples/query.go
package examples

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

**Key points:**
- Use `@@table` to resolve the model's table name dynamically.
- Use `@param` to bind Go parameters safely.
- Write interfaces in the same package or directory as models.

---

## Step 2: Run the CLI Generator to Create Code

The CLI tool reads your interfaces and models, then generates two essential code sets:

- **Type-safe Query APIs** based on your interface methods
- **Model-driven Field Helpers** for filters, updates, and association operations

### CLI Command

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

- `-i` specifies the input directory containing your interfaces and models.
- `-o` specifies the output directory where generated files will be created.

This command produces generated code you can import and use directly.

---

## Step 3: Using the Generated APIs in Your Code

Use the generated query APIs and field helpers seamlessly with your GORM database instance.

### Examples

```go
// Import the generated package
import "generated"

// Retrieve user by ID with compile-time safety
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Complex filtering using generated field helpers
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
```

This approach guarantees your queries are type-safe and expressive, reducing runtime errors.

---

## Deeper into the Generated Code Types

### Query APIs from Interfaces
- Each method maps to a concrete Go implementation with embedded SQL templates.
- Supports context auto-injection if your method lacks explicit `context.Context` parameter.

### Field Helpers from Models
- Generates strongly typed helpers for primitives and associations.
- Supports common predicates (`Eq`, `Like`, `Between`, `IsNull`), update setters (`Set`, `Incr`, `SetExpr`), and complex association operations like `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, and `Delete`.

Use these helpers to build fluent queries and update expressions.

---

## Practical Example Workflow in Context

```go
// 1. Seed DB
seedUsers(t, db, models.User{Name: "alice", Age: 20})

// 2. Use generated query api
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 1) // type-safe

// 3. Use field helpers to filter
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Like("%alice%"), generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)

// 4. Update with association operations
err = gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Name.Set("alice_updated"), generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido"))).
  Update(ctx)
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep interfaces and models close:** Organizing related code in the same package or directory simplifies generation and understanding.
- **Use the Template DSL to tailor queries:** Use `@@table`, `@param`, and conditional blocks like `{{where}}` to make dynamic queries.
- **Adopt Field Helpers for associations:** Effectively manipulate related records with `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, and `Delete` methods.
- **Run generation often:** Synchronize generated code with your changing data models to avoid stale queries or runtime errors.
- **Explore examples:** Check `examples/` directory for sample queries and tests to accelerate your learning.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Quickstart Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="I get errors running 'gorm gen'">
Make sure:
- Your interface files include required SQL templates in comments.
- Interfaces and models are in the specified input directory.
- You use Go 1.18+ because generics are required.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated code doesn't compile">
- Check that your models and interfaces are error-free.
- Confirm that the output directory is correctly imported.
- Ensure your project is using the same Go module path.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Queries return unexpected results">
- Verify your SQL templates and parameter bindings.
- Use logging or `db.Debug()` to inspect generated SQL.
