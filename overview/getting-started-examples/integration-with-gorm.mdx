# Integration with GORM & Ecosystem

GORM CLI is designed to seamlessly fit into your standard GORM projects, enhancing your development workflow with type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers. This page explains how to integrate GORM CLI with GORM, details critical version requirements, highlights interoperability considerations, and points you to configuration options for advanced customization.

---

## Why Integrate GORM CLI with GORM?

If you already use GORM, the popular Go ORM, GORM CLI extends its capabilities by generating strongly typed query interfaces and helpers based on your Go code. This integration lets you write expressive, compile-time safe database queries and operations while retaining all the usual flexibility and tooling of GORM.

By combining GORM CLI with GORM, you can:

- **Eliminate boilerplate**: No more manually writing repetitive SQL or verbose query helpers.
- **Improve safety**: Detect query errors at compile time instead of runtime.
- **Boost productivity**: Intuitive generated APIs accelerate coding and reduce guesswork.

The result is a fluent, discoverable API that merges the power of GORM’s ORM capabilities with rich type safety and efficiency.

## Requirements and Compatibility

### Go Version

- **Go 1.18 or later** is required, as GORM CLI uses Go generics extensively to generate type-safe code.

### GORM Version

- Compatible with standard versions of `gorm.io/gorm`. There are no additional patches or forks required.

### Code Generation Context

- Your models and query interfaces should be defined alongside or within your Go packages that use GORM.
- GORM CLI reads these inputs and produces generated code you import and use alongside GORM’s DB instance.

<Tip>
Make sure your project uses Go Modules and that all dependencies, including GORM and GORM CLI, are up to date to avoid compatibility issues during code generation and compilation.
</Tip>

## How Integration Works

GORM CLI generates two key components:

1. **Interface-Driven Query APIs**

   - You define Go interfaces with SQL templates as method comments.
   - GORM CLI generates methods that wrap `gorm.DB` queries with type-safe parameter bindings.

2. **Model-Driven Field Helpers**

   - From your Go structs representing models, the generator creates field-level helpers for querying and updates.
   - These helpers support simple fields and complex associations, making condition construction and association management easier.

These generated artifacts fit naturally with your GORM DB connections.

### Using Generated APIs with GORM

Here's a typical user flow integrating GORM CLI with GORM:

```go
// Initialize GORM DB
db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("test.db"), &gorm.Config{})
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}

// Use generated Query interface for type-safe calls
userQuery := generated.Query[models.User](db)

// Get a user by ID
user, err := userQuery.GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
  // handle error
}

// Use model-driven field helpers with GORM queries
var adults []models.User
err = gorm.G[models.User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
    Find(ctx, &adults)
```

This pattern harnesses the power of both tools: GORM as the underlying runtime engine and GORM CLI for safe, concise query construction.

## Configuration Flexibility for Advanced Scenarios

You can configure GORM CLI generation behavior to tailor it to your project's specific needs.

### `genconfig.Config` Overview

This Go-native configuration struct optionally declared in your packages controls generation.

Key configurable aspects include:

- **Output Path:** Customize where generated files are placed.
- **Field Maps:** Override default field helper types for specific Go field types or struct tags.
- **Filtering:** Include or exclude interfaces and structs by name patterns or explicit specifications.
- **File Level Scope:** Generate helpers per file instead of per package to limit scope.

#### Example Configuration

```go
package examples

import (
  "database/sql"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/field"
  "gorm.io/cli/gorm/genconfig"
)

var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "examples/output",
  FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
    sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
  },
  FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
    "json": JSON{}, // Use custom JSON helper for fields tagged with `gen:"json"`
  },
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  IncludeStructs: []any{"User", "Account*"},
}
```

### Custom Field Helpers

You can define your own field helpers, for example to handle JSON columns differently depending on the database.

### Template-Based SQL Querying

You can write advanced SQL templated methods inside interfaces, leveraging conditionals and parameter bindings.

## Best Practices for Smooth Integration

- Define your GORM models with associations clearly annotated.
- Place query interfaces and models logically together.
- Use `genconfig.Config` to customize generation and avoid unnecessary files.
- Keep Go and GORM dependencies current.
- Use contexts on generated methods — the CLI will auto-insert context if missing.

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Integration Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Code Generation Fails or Skips Files">
Ensure that `genconfig.Config` is correctly defined and accessible in the same package/folder as your interfaces and models. Verify `IncludeInterfaces` and `IncludeStructs` patterns match your types.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated Code Won’t Compile">
Check your Go version is 1.18+ and your GORM dependency is compatible with generics. Confirm that your import paths and module setup allows visibility of generated packages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Association Helpers Not Working as Expected">
Confirm your GORM model associations use standard GORM tagging conventions (`has many`, `belongs to`, `many2many`). The generator follows these annotations strictly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Integrating GORM CLI into your GORM ecosystem empowers your Go applications with type-safe, expressive database interaction APIs and powerful model helpers. With minimal setup and flexible customization, your projects gain enhanced safety, productivity, and maintainability without losing GORM’s rich ORM features.
