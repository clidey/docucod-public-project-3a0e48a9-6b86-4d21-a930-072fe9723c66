title: "Who Should Use GORM CLI?"
description: "Designed for Go developers using GORM in projects of all sizes—including those seeking enhanced safety, clarity, and maintainability in their data access code. Ideal for teams aiming to reduce manual query logic, enforce type-safety for queries and updates, and rapidly prototype without sacrificing correctness."

# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed specifically for Go developers working with the GORM ORM framework who want to elevate their database interaction through type-safe, intuitive, and maintainable code generation. Whether you are building simple applications or complex systems, this tool empowers you to automate and enforce best practices in your data access layer.

## Unleash the Power of Type Safety

If you have ever experienced runtime errors caused by malformed SQL queries, mismatched fields, or misaligned query parameters, GORM CLI offers a robust solution. By generating strongly typed, interface-driven query APIs and model-driven field helpers, it ensures that your database operations are validated at compile time, drastically reducing error rates.

### Ideal User Profiles

- **Go Developers Using GORM:** If your primary ORM is GORM and you want to integrate code generation directly with your models and query interfaces.
- **Teams Enforcing Code Safety:** Development teams focused on eliminating boilerplate query code and preventing manual SQL mistakes.
- **Projects Requiring Maintainability:** Systems that require clear, discoverable, and fluent APIs to manage database reads, writes, and association operations.
- **Rapid Prototyping and Iteration:** Developers who want to quickly evolve their data layer with custom queries and updates without losing type safety.

---

## What Can You Achieve?

Using GORM CLI, you gain:

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Define interfaces with SQL templates, and automatically generate implementations where method signatures enforce correct parameter types and return types.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Automatically generated helpers for filtering, setting updates, and managing associations, significantly reducing manual coding and error-prone query building.
- **Safe Association Handling:** Effortlessly perform create, update, unlink, batch operations on associations with compile-time validation.

Example user flow:

1. Define your Go model struct normally, including any associations.
2. Write interfaces with SQL template comments describing your queries.
3. Run GORM CLI to generate the API code.
4. Use the generated APIs in your application, confident that types and SQL bindings are verified.

---

## Concrete Use Cases

- **Eliminating Manual Query Boilerplate:** Instead of writing repetitive CRUD queries or filter methods, define query interfaces and let GORM CLI generate the implementations.
- **Enforcing Query Correctness:** Catch mismatched parameters, SQL syntax errors, or missing fields before runtime.
- **Handling Complex Associations Safely:** Manage nested relations like `has one`, `has many`, `many2many` with APIs that prevent foreign key mistakes.
- **Customizing Queries with SQL Templates:** Create powerful query interfaces that include conditional where-clauses, dynamic columns, and update logic.

For example, a developer can write a query interface method with a comment SQL template such as:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

and GORM CLI generates a fully type-safe, ready-to-use implementation.

## Avoid Common Pitfalls

- If you’re still manually composing SQL strings or using generic query builders without type checking, GORM CLI prevents errors by binding your parameters and queries at the interface level.
- Manual updates to associated entities can cause subtle FK or data integrity issues; the generated association helpers provide explicit unlink/delete semantics aligned to association types.
- Struggling with inconsistent query logic across your codebase? Centralizing query interface definitions with GORM CLI harmonizes usage.

---

## Getting Started

To verify that GORM CLI fits your workflow:

- Make sure your project uses Go 1.18+ with generics.
- Have your models already defined with or without GORM tags.
- Write query interfaces using the SQL template DSL.
- Run `gorm gen` to generate queries and helpers.
- Use the resulting code in your application for robust, fluent data access.
