# What is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a powerful command-line tool designed to boost productivity and code quality for Go developers working with the GORM ORM framework. It generates type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-driven field helpers based on your Go interfaces and model structs, helping you write precise, reliable database access code while catching errors at compile time.

---

## Why GORM CLI Matters

Imagine building complex database operations where every SQL query is automatically crafted to match your application's data models and logic — without risking mismatches or runtime errors. GORM CLI enables this through automatic code generation, turning your declarative interface definitions and Go structs into fully typed, fluent APIs that integrate seamlessly with GORM.

By automating the creation of these APIs, GORM CLI eliminates repetitive manual coding, reduces bugs, and accelerates your development workflow.

---

## What GORM CLI Does

### Generates Interface-Driven Query APIs
Write Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates as comments, and GORM CLI generates concrete implementations with type safety. This ensures your queries are:

- Statically checked for correctness
- Fully integrated with your Go types
- Easy to discover and use, thanks to fluent method signatures

### Creates Model-Driven Field Helpers
From your model structs, the tool generates strongly typed field helpers to perform common operations like:

- Filtering: Build condition expressions easily
- Updates: Define safe setters for fields
- Association management: Create, update, unlink, or delete related entities with compile-time guarantees

This means less manual SQL handling and fewer runtime surprises.

---

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Compile-time Safety:** Catch SQL and type errors early during development, well before runtime.
- **Fluent and Discoverable APIs:** The generated code provides readable, intuitive query and update methods.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Outputs code that works out-of-the-box with `gorm.io/gorm`.
- **Flexible Template DSL:** SQL embedded in interface comments supports conditional logic, dynamic parameters, and iteration for expressing complex queries.
- **Configurable Generation:** Customize the output paths, included interfaces, structs, and field mappings via package-level configurations.

---

## Real-World Example Walkthrough

1. **Define Your Query Interface and Models**

```go
// Define your query interface with SQL templates as comments
// Each method represents a query with parameter binding and conditionals

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // More flexible methods with dynamic columns and filters can also be defined
}

// Define your data model struct

type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

2. **Run GORM CLI to Generate Code**

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

This scans the input directory, processes your interfaces and structs, and produces strongly typed query APIs and field helpers.

3. **Use the Generated APIs in Your Application**

```go
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123) // Type-safe retrieval

users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx) // Filter users with Age > 18
```

These calls are backed by generated code providing auto-completion and error checking.

## How Does It Fit into Your Workflow?

- **Start with your domain models and query interfaces:** Embed your queries as annotated Go interfaces.
- **Run the `gorm gen` CLI tool:** It parses your code, extracts SQL templates, and generates ready-to-use Go source files.
- **Import and use generated packages:** Your application accesses database records through these compiled, safe APIs instead of raw SQL.

The page [internal/gen/gen.go] details the CLI command implementation that powers this workflow.

---

## Helpful Tips for New Users

- Always annotate SQL queries using the supported template DSL to leverage dynamic filtering and updates.
- Use the package-level `genconfig.Config` to customize generation behavior: output paths, included types, and custom field mappings.
- Follow naming conventions for interfaces and structs to control which elements get generated.
- Enable context parameters in your method signatures to integrate with Go’s `context.Context` for tracing and cancellation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Missing Generated Files After Running CLI">
Confirm that the `-i` input path points to the correct directory containing your Go interfaces and models. Ensure the SQL templates in your interface comments are correctly formatted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated Methods Not Found at Compile Time">
Check if your package-level `genconfig.Config` excludes the interfaces or structs by pattern unintentionally. Also, ensure the generated output directory is properly imported in your Go project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SQL Syntax Errors in Generated Queries">
Verify your embedded SQL templates use supported DSL directives (`@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, etc.) correctly. Invalid template syntax causes generation errors.
