# Product Value & Use Cases

## Unlocking Type Safety and Discoverability for GORM

GORM CLI transforms how Go developers interact with databases by generating strongly typed, discoverable query APIs and model-driven field helpers directly from your model and interface definitions. This page explores why adopting GORM CLI elevates safety, productivity, and maintainability in your Go projects.

---

### Why GORM CLI Matters

For developers and teams working with GORM, writing correct and maintainable database queries can be a repetitive and error-prone task. GORM CLI solves this by providing:

- **Compile-time safety:** All query APIs and operations are generated with Go’s type system to catch mistakes before runtime.
- **Fluent, discoverable APIs:** Code completion and intuitive method names make querying and manipulation straightforward.
- **Consistent model-driven utilities:** Generate field helpers that cover filters, updates, and complex associations with ease.

Whether you are building new features or refactoring legacy code, GORM CLI provides a robust foundation that couples your database operations tightly with your model design.

---

## Who Benefits From GORM CLI?

- **Go development teams** seeking safer, maintainable database interactions
- **Projects emphasizing compile-time validation** over dynamic query strings
- **Applications requiring complex association management** with automated, type-safe operations
- **Developers integrating SQL templated queries** with Go interfaces who want productivity gains and reduced bugs

---

## Core Value Propositions

- **Type-safe Query APIs from Interfaces:** Write clean Go interfaces with SQL templates and instantly generate concrete implementations with error-free type safety.

- **Model-driven Field Helpers:** Use your model structs to automatically generate helpers for filtering, ordering, updating fields, and managing associations without manual coding.

- **Safe & Fluent Association Operations:** Perform create, update, unlink, delete operations on associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many2many) ensuring referential integrity and correctness.

- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Generated code complements the `gorm.io/gorm` ecosystem, letting you smoothly incorporate generated query APIs alongside native GORM usage.

- **Configurable Code Generation:** Tailor your generation with flexible config options to include/exclude specific interfaces or structs, customize field mappings, and control output structure.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Safer Querying with Intuitive APIs
Instead of hand-crafting SQL strings prone to errors, write Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates:

```go
// Define a type-safe query interface
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

GORM CLI generates concrete methods to safely run this query, enabling code completion and compile-time checking.

### 2. Simplifying Complex Association Management
Managing relationships like `has many` or `many2many` can be tricky. With generated helpers, expressing operations becomes natural:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This creates a new user and associates a pet in one atomic operation with safeguards on foreign keys.

### 3. Maintaining Consistency Across Codebase
Strongly typed generated code reduces duplicated logic and promotes DRY principles across teams, with auto-generated helpers reflecting model changes instantly.

## Before & After Adoption

| Without GORM CLI                             | With GORM CLI                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Hand-built SQL strings prone to runtime errors | Compile-time validated, type-safe queries             |
| Manual association management workflows      | Fluent, discoverable association helper methods    |
| Fragmented query logic across the codebase   | Centralized, model-driven generated APIs           |
| Limited code completion for query building    | Full IDE support and discoverability for query method calls |

---

## Measurable Benefits

- **Reduce runtime SQL errors** by shifting detection to compile-time
- **Boost developer productivity** with auto-generated, discoverable APIs
- **Enhance code maintainability** by consolidating query logic in generated files
- **Scale database operations safely** in complex applications with robust association helpers

---

## Getting Started Preview

Unlock the value by first defining your models and query interfaces, then invoking the GORM CLI generator:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

You’ll receive fully type-safe query APIs and strongly typed field helpers immediately consumable in your Go code, reducing manual coding overhead.

<Check>
Make sure your Go environment is version 1.18+ to support generics, a key GORM CLI prerequisite.
</Check>

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Begin with clean, well-structured model definitions** to maximize quality of generated field helpers
- **Craft query interfaces with SQL templates carefully** to express logic simply and clearly
- **Leverage configuration options** (`genconfig.Config`) to customize generation scope and mappings
- **Incorporate generated code under version control** but avoid manual edits—treat as generated artifacts

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- Trying to generate with Go versions earlier than 1.18 will fail due to generics requirement.
- Ignoring association types might produce incorrect unlink/delete semantics—understand the difference between belongs to, has one/many, and many2many.
- Generated code might not reflect model changes until you re-run generation.
