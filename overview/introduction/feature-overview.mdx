# Feature Summary

Discover the core capabilities of GORM CLI through this concise feature summary. This page highlights the major functionalities you can expect when using GORM CLI—from interface-driven, type-safe query APIs to model-driven field helpers and comprehensive association management. Understand what differentiates GORM CLI and get a clear expectation of its powerful workflows to boost your GORM-based Go projects.

## What You Will Gain

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Generate Go interfaces from raw SQL templates that provide compile-time checked, fluent, and discoverable query methods.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Leverage strongly-typed field helpers generated from your model structs to simplify filters, updates, ordering, and association handling.
- **Association Operations:** Safely create, update, unlink, and delete related database records using association helpers, avoiding common errors and boilerplate.
- **Configurable Code Generation:** Tailor the generation process via package-level configuration to include/exclude interfaces or structs, customize field mappings, and control file output.
- **Template-Based SQL DSL:** Express complex SQL queries and updates through a powerful templating language embedded in interface comments, making queries clear and reusable.

---

## Overview of Features

### 1. Interface-Driven Type-Safe Query APIs
Write Go interfaces with embedded SQL comments to describe queries. GORM CLI transforms these into concrete implementations with method signatures fully checked at compile time.

Example of a query interface:
```go
// Query interface with SQL templates
 type Query[T any] interface {
   // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
   GetByID(id int) (T, error)

   // WHERE clause generated from method param
   FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
 }
```
Users get fluent, error-proof functions aligned with their database schema, reducing runtime failures caused by invalid queries.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers
From your Go model structs, GORM CLI generates typed field helpers representing columns and associations. These helpers simplify building conditions and update statements.

Example field predicates:
```go
generated.User.ID.Eq(1)                 // id = 1
generated.User.Name.Like("%jinzhu%")   // name LIKE '%jinzhu%'
generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)     // age BETWEEN 18 AND 65
```
These helpers allow clear and concise expression of SQL conditions without manually writing raw strings.

### 3. Association Management Helpers
GORM CLI generates helpers for all supported associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many-to-many), enabling operations such as:
- Creating and linking associated records
- Updating associated rows conditionally
- Unlinking without deleting data
- Deleting associated records safely

Example:
```go
// Creating a user and linking pets
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)

// Unlink pets conditionally
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("fido")).Unlink()).
  Update(ctx)
```

These operations provide clarity and safety when working with relational data.

### 4. Powerful Template-Based SQL DSL
Use a rich templating DSL to write raw SQL with dynamic clauses and parameter binding directly in interface method comments. This DSL supports:
- Table and column placeholder bindings (`@@table`, `@@column`)
- Named parameter binding (`@param`)
- Conditional clauses (`{{if ...}} ... {{end}}`)
- Iteration and range loops over slices (`{{for ...}} ... {{end}}`)

Example:
```sql
// SELECT * FROM @@table
// {{where}}
//   {{if !start.IsZero()}}
//     created_at > @start
//   {{end}}
//   {{if !end.IsZero()}}
//     AND created_at < @end
//   {{end}}
// {{end}}
FilterWithTime(start, end time.Time) ([]T, error)
```
This approach integrates SQL’s power with Go’s type safety and expressive tooling.

### 5. Configurable Generation with `genconfig.Config`
Control generation scope and behavior with package-level configurations, including:
- Output paths
- Inclusion or exclusion filters for interfaces and structs
- Field type and name mappings for custom helpers
- Fine-grained file-level controls

Example snippet:
```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "examples/output",
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
  FieldNameMap: map[string]any{"json": JSON{}},
}
```

## Why This Matters: Benefits & Use Cases

- **Robustness:** Early error detection through compile-time type checking prevents runtime SQL mistakes and inconsistencies.
- **Productivity:** Fluent and discoverable APIs reduce the need to write raw SQL strings and repetitive query logic.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized configuration and model-driven code reduce duplications and facilitate controlled code generation.
- **Complex Relationship Handling:** Detailed association helpers manage relational semantics safely, including unlinking vs deleting differences.

**Typical usage scenarios:**
- Back-end services requiring safe and maintainable database access layers
- Teams adopting GORM who want more compile-time guarantees
- Projects needing complex association operations abstracted into fluent APIs

---

## Key Workflows At a Glance

1. **Define Your Models:** Create Go structs representing your database tables.
2. **Write Query Interfaces:** Define generics-based interfaces with method comments containing SQL templates.
3. **Configure Generation (Optional):** Adjust `genconfig.Config` to tailor output and mappings.
4. **Run GORM CLI Generator:** Execute the CLI to produce strongly typed, compile-checked query implementations and field helpers.
5. **Use Generated APIs:** Utilize generated fluent query and update methods with type safety and expressiveness.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- Always keep your model structs and interfaces in sync to ensure accurate field and association generation.
- Use the template DSL judiciously; complex conditions should be broken down clearly to avoid unreadable comments.
- Remember the semantic differences in unlink/delete operations for associations to avoid unintentional data loss.
- Leverage configuration filters to manage large projects with many interfaces and models to optimize generation time.
- For JSON or custom data types, define appropriate field helpers and map them via `FieldNameMap` or `FieldTypeMap`.
