# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits Most from GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is meticulously designed for **Go developers working on data-intensive applications** who rely on [GORM](https://gorm.io) as their ORM layer. Whether you are building a small project or developing complex systems for enterprise environments, GORM CLI empowers you to write safer, cleaner, and more maintainable data access code.

### Ideal Users

- **Individual Developers** who want to eliminate repetitive boilerplate around database queries and updates.
- **Development Teams** aiming to enforce compile-time safety across their data access layer, reducing runtime errors caused by incorrect SQL or mismatched fields.
- **Architects and Leads** looking for scalable solutions that enhance collaboration by generating self-documenting, discoverable APIs.
- **Maintainability Advocates** who want automatic generation of model helpers and query interfaces that evolve with database schema changes.

## Key Use Cases

GORM CLI targets core scenarios that every Go developer working with GORM encounters regularly:

### 1. Generate Clean, Type-Safe Query Interfaces

Instead of manually writing repetitive SQL queries or GORM builder code, you write interfaces annotated with SQL templates, and GORM CLI generates fully functional, type-safe query APIs. This ensures:

- Queries are consistent and type-safe at compile time.
- SQL statements are embedded directly and can use dynamic placeholders.
- Intuitive generated methods make querying straightforward even for complex conditions.

**Example:**

```go
// User query interface
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id AND name = "@name"
GetByID(id int) (User, error)
```
When generated, this lets you call:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

### 2. Automate Model Helper Generation for Fields and Associations

GORM CLI parses your GORM model structs to produce dedicated helpers for fields and associations:

- Build filters, updates, and ordering with strongly typed helpers.
- Manage associations with semantics appropriate to `has one`, `has many`, `belongs to`, and `many2many`.
- Perform common association operations (create, update, unlink, delete) with the confidence that foreign key constraints and relations are handled correctly.

**Example:**

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

### 3. Improve Data Access Code for Teams of All Sizes

By adopting GORM CLI, your team benefits from:

- **Consistency:** Centralized code generation avoids divergence and reduces bugs.
- **Discoverability:** Generated APIs are intuitive and easier to navigate than hand-coded SQL builders.
- **Productivity:** Developers spend less time writing and maintaining boilerplate.
- **Scalability:** As your schema grows, regenerating keeps APIs synchronized without manual upkeep.

## Before and After GORM CLI

| Before                               | After with GORM CLI                                |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Manual SQL strings prone to errors | Typed query interfaces prevent field mismatches  |
| Repetitive boilerplate code        | Generated helpers for filters and updates         |
| Complex association management     | Easy, declarative association operations          |
| Inconsistent coding styles         | Uniform pattern enforced by code generation        |

## Practical Examples of Use

- **Filtering users by multiple fields** without writing complex builder code:

```go
filters := []models.User{{Name: "alice", Age: 20}, {Name: "dan", Age: 40}}
results, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).Filter(ctx, filters)
```

- **Updating user info with conditional logic**:

```go
err := generated.Query[models.User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, models.User{Name: "alice", Age: 20}, 1)
```

- **Handling associations declaratively**:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Languages.CreateInBatch([]models.Language{{Code: "EN"}, {Code: "FR"}})).
  Update(ctx)
```

## Why You Should Care

- **Avoid runtime errors** caused by misspelled columns or mismatched query parameters.
- **Speed up development** by generating most of your data access boilerplate.
- **Maintain codebase health** with APIs that evolve alongside your database schema.
- **Empower your team** with fluent, discoverable methods minimizing the learning curve.
