# Why Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed to transform how you interact with your databases in Go projects using GORM. By adopting GORM CLI, developers eliminate repetitive handwritten SQL and boilerplate code, significantly reducing runtime errors and accelerating the onboarding process for new contributors.

## Unlocking Safer, More Productive Development

### Minimize Runtime Query Errors

Traditional raw SQL or manually written GORM queries can lead to subtle bugs or mismatched parameters that surface only at runtime. GORM CLI generates type-safe query APIs directly from Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates. This compile-time safety helps catch mistakes early, providing confidence that your queries are correct before they run.

### Eliminate Boilerplate Code

Writing CRUD operations and complex query logic by hand is tedious, error-prone, and hard to maintain. GORM CLI automates code generation for query interfaces and field helper methods based on your models and interface definitions. This automation:

- Removes repetitive coding work
- Provides consistent, clear APIs
- Streamlines updates when models or queries change

### Improve Developer Productivity and Onboarding

Generated APIs have explicit, discoverable methods that reflect your database schema and query intent. New team members can quickly understand and use database operations without steep learning curves about raw SQL or GORM internals. This leads to faster feature development and fewer mistakes.

### Enhance Code Clarity and Maintainability

By leveraging interface-driven code generation, your project benefits from:

- Clear query semantics aligned with your domain models
- Intuitive method names matching query intent
- Easy customization via declarative SQL templates and configuration

This reduces cognitive overhead and allows your team to focus on business logic rather than plumbing.

## Real-World Benefits Illustrated

Imagine a project with multiple teams contributing to a large database schema. Without GORM CLI, each developer writes queries ad hoc, which results in inconsistent styles, varied error handling, and repeated bugs from SQL syntax issues or misused parameters.

With GORM CLI:

- Teams define interfaces with expressive SQL comments.
- The generator ensures all generated methods are type-safe and consistent.
- Common bugs like parameter mismatches are caught at build time.
- Model-driven field helpers simplify filter and association queries.
- New contributors can use generated APIs without deep SQL or GORM expertise.

As a result, the project experiences fewer runtime errors and delivers features faster.

## Key Advantages at a Glance

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Your raw SQL queries become strongly typed Go methods.
- **Automated Field Helpers:** Easily construct filters, updates, and association operations.
- **Customizable Generation:** Tailor generation behavior via simple package-level configs.
- **Integration with GORM:** Seamlessly combine generated code with idiomatic GORM usage.

## How GORM CLI Helps You Achieve These Benefits

- You start by writing Go interfaces with SQL templates in method comments.
- The CLI scans your Go files, parses interfaces and structs, then generates concrete, executable code.
- Context parameters are injected automatically, and SQL placeholders are bound safely.
- Field helper generation offers a fluent API for common SQL predicates and updates.

With this process, you gain:

- Reduced manual coding effort for queries and filters
- Immediate validation of SQL logic through Go’s type system
- Cohesive and maintainable data access layers

## Before and After Using GORM CLI

| Before                                          | After                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Manually writing SQL queries prone to typos     | Generated type-safe query methods validate at compile time |
| Scattered and inconsistent query code           | Unified, interface-driven APIs with clear semantics    |
| Boilerplate for building filters, updates, and associations | Generated field helpers simplify complex query building |
| Errors discovered only at runtime                | Safer code with earlier failure detection               |

## Getting Started

To leverage these benefits, you begin by defining your query interfaces and models. Then, run the generator CLI specifying input files and output directory. Once generated, your application can immediately use the fluent, type-safe APIs in place of raw queries.

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

<Tip>
Maximize productivity by defining your interfaces with clear, concise SQL templates and rely on GORM CLI to generate all repetitive code. This keeps your business logic clean and focused.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Missing Context Parameter:** If your interface methods lack `context.Context`, GORM CLI automatically injects it to ensure proper context propagation.
- **SQL Template Errors:** SQL templates must bind parameters to method arguments precisely. Incorrect placeholders will cause generation failures.
- **Configuration Overrides:** Use `genconfig.Config` in your packages to control output paths, include or exclude specific interfaces or structs, and map custom field types.

Refer to the [Configuration & Customization](../quick-features/customization-overview) page for details.

By integrating GORM CLI into your development workflow, you shift from fragile, boilerplate-heavy code to robust, readable, and maintainable database access layers — accelerating development while reducing errors.
