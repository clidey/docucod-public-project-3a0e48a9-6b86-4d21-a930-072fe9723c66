# Target Audience & Use Cases

GORM CLI has been meticulously crafted for Go engineers who rely on the GORM ORM framework to manage database interactions. It’s especially valuable for teams and developers in enterprise environments, SaaS products, and startup backends aiming to streamline their data access layers with type safety and rapid development cycles.

---

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

- **Go Backend Engineers**: Developers building or maintaining backend services in Go that interact with relational databases through GORM.
- **Teams Seeking Robustness & Safety**: Organizations that prioritize catching query-related errors at compile time instead of at runtime.
- **Developers Upgrading Legacy GORM Projects**: Those migrating existing GORM codebases to adopt more maintainable, type-safe APIs generated by GORM CLI.
- **Rapid Prototypers and Greenfield Projects**: Engineers who want to accelerate building APIs by leveraging generated query interfaces and helpers instead of writing raw SQL or repetitive boilerplate.

---

## Common Adoption Scenarios

### 1. Greenfield Project Development
Starting a backend from scratch with Go and GORM? GORM CLI jump-starts your development by automating the most error-prone and repetitive parts of data access:

- Define your data models and query interfaces once.
- Let GORM CLI generate fully type-safe, fluent query APIs.
- Spend more time focusing on business logic rather than boilerplate code.

This leads to faster delivery and fewer bugs in early-stage projects.

### 2. Legacy GORM Codebase Modernization
If you have an existing codebase using hand-written queries or dynamic SQL constructions with GORM, adopting GORM CLI helps you:

- Replace fragile, error-prone query constructs with compile-time checked interfaces.
- Introduce consistency and discoverability in how data access methods are written and maintained.
- Incrementally migrate old code by coexisting generated code alongside legacy features.

### 3. Rapid API Prototyping and Iteration
For startups and teams that need to iterate quickly:

- Define flexible query interfaces with embedded SQL templates.
- Automatically get tailor-made query and mutation APIs that reflect your data model.
- Effortlessly extend or customize queries using templates without compromising type safety.

This enables quick experimentation without sacrificing code quality or introducing runtime errors.

---

## Why Does This Matter?

Before GORM CLI, writing complex queries and database mutations required a mix of manual SQL and GORM’s query builder. This can introduce:

- Runtime errors due to mistyped column names or mismatched parameters.
- Repetitive, unstructured query logic and scattered business rules.
- Difficulty in maintaining and refactoring large codebases.

With GORM CLI, you unlock:

- **Compile-Time Safety**: Prevent common query mistakes early by generating code that the compiler verifies.
- **Type-Safe Fluent APIs**: Use discoverable and intuitive data access methods that fit naturally in Go’s type system.
- **Accelerated Development**: Reduce boilerplate and focus on adding real value.

## Real-World Use Case Examples

### Scenario: Company Backend with Complex Relations
Imagine a SaaS service tracking users, their pets, accounts, and roles:

- Define models with associations (`User`, `Pet`, `Account`, `Language`).
- Generate field helpers for querying fields like `User.Age`, `User.Role`, `Pet.Name`.
- Write interface-driven queries with templated SQL to retrieve users with complex filters, updates, and batch operations.

Using GORM CLI, developers can safely perform operations like:

```go
// Fetch user by ID with compile-time safety
u, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Filter users by name and age with typed params
users, err := generated.Query[models.User](db).FilterByNameAndAge(ctx, "alice", 30)

// Update user's info conditionally
err = generated.Query[models.User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, models.User{Name: "bob", Age: 28}, 123)
```

### Scenario: Migrating an Evolving Product
A startup refactors from handwritten SQL in Go to enhanced GORM usage:

- Incrementally add generated query interfaces for new features.
- Use generated model field helpers for safer association management.
- Stop runtime bugs related to missing or mistyped SQL parameters.

This smooth transition supports scalability as the codebase grows.

## Practical Tips for Choosing GORM CLI

- If your team is committed to GORM as the ORM and you want to catch more bugs at compile time, GORM CLI is a must-have.
- For existing codebases, start by generating field helpers and query APIs for core models, then expand.
- Use SQL templates inside interfaces to capture frequently used queries and mutations, simplifying maintenance.
