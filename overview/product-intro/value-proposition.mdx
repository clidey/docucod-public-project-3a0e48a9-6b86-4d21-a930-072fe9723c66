# Value Proposition & Key Benefits of GORM CLI

## Unlock Safer, Faster, and More Expressive Go Database Interactions

GORM CLI transforms how Go developers build database queries by generating fully type-safe, model-driven query APIs and field helpers directly from your Go structs and interfaces. It enables clearer code, fewer runtime errors, and accelerates development velocity—all while seamlessly integrating into the GORM ecosystem.

### Why GORM CLI Matters to You

- **Eliminate Runtime Query Errors**  
  Catch invalid queries at compile time with generated, type-safe APIs that reflect your data models.

- **Write Safer, More Expressive Queries**  
  Use fluent chainable APIs that prevent SQL injection and encourage clean, maintainable query construction.

- **Accelerate Development Cycles**  
  Auto-generate repetitive query layers and field helpers, freeing you to focus on business logic.

- **Enjoy Seamless GORM Integration**  
  Built specifically for GORM, your generated code fits directly into your existing project with zero friction.

- **Leverage Dual Code Generation Models**  
  Benefit from a balanced approach supporting both querying and data mutation APIs, ensuring your interfaces align with your evolving application needs.

### What Is GORM CLI Offering?

GORM CLI is a dedicated Go code generator that reads your query interface definitions and Go model structs to produce fully typed Go code for database queries and updates. This code leverages GORM's powerful ORM capabilities but shields you from common pitfalls by shifting query validation to compile-time.

By automating code creation, GORM CLI removes the need to handwrite error-prone SQL snippets or repeatedly define query logic. Instead, it provides:

- **Type-safe Query Interfaces:** Pattern your interfaces with Go generics and methods clearly describing your database operations.
- **Model-Driven Field & Association Helpers:** Generate helpers aligned with your ORM model definitions, facilitating safer and clearer association handling.

| Seamless GORM Ecosystem Fit | Generated code uses GORM under the hood, fitting cleanly into existing projects                  | Minimal disruption integrating new code generation workflows, leveraging GORM’s familiarity and features                                                       |

### How GORM CLI's Dual Code Generation Model Supports You

GORM CLI takes a comprehensive approach by generating APIs that handle both data retrieval and data mutation:

- **Querying APIs:** Methods returning typed data with flexible filters and composable conditions.
- **Mutation APIs:** Methods supporting safe updates and inserts, ensuring consistency with your model definitions.

This dual approach empowers you to express complex CRUD operations in a type-safe manner, reducing manual coding overhead and increasing reliability.

### Concrete Example: Safer Data Retrieval and Update

Given the following interface method in your code:

```go
// GetByID query data by id and return it as struct
//
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id AND name = "@name"
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

GORM CLI generates go code that safely builds and executes this query with parameter binding, eliminating injection risks while providing a clearly typed return value.

Similarly, updating user information with:

```go
// UpdateInfo updates columns conditionally, setting is_adult status
// UPDATE @@table
//  {{set}}
//    {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name, {{end}}
//    {{if user.Age > 0}} age=@user.Age, {{end}}
//    {{if user.Age >= 18}} is_adult=1 {{else}} is_adult=0 {{end}}
//  {{end}}
// WHERE id=@id
UpdateInfo(user models.User, id int) error
```

Generates an efficient update that only affects changed columns, respecting your business logic through expressive templates.

### Best Practices When Using GORM CLI

- **Define Clear Interfaces:** Use Go generics and method comments to describe your desired queries clearly.
- **Keep Models Up to Date:** Synchronize your model structs as the source of truth for queries and generated helpers.
- **Customize With Configs:** Exclude or include specific interfaces or structs to tailor generation to your project needs.
- **Leverage Generated Helpers:** Use association and field helpers to navigate complex relationships safely.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Modifying generated code directly instead of adjusting interfaces or configurations.
- Omitting error checking in method returns—generated code returns both data and errors.
- Overlooking configuration possibilities to fine-tune generation scope.
