# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe, Interface-Driven Database Access for Go Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed to accelerate and secure your database interactions in Go applications built with GORM. It automatically generates type-safe, interface-based query APIs and model-driven field helpers, dramatically reducing boilerplate code and eliminating common runtime errors.

### Why GORM CLI Matters

- **Type-Safety at Compile Time:** Avoid SQL errors and type mismatches by leveraging Go’s strong typing through generated interfaces.
- **Fluent, Discoverable APIs:** Navigate complex queries and mutations easily with intuitive, interface-driven method calls.
- **Flexible SQL Template Support:** Write custom SQL directly in Go interface comments to tailor queries precisely.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Manipulate fields confidently with generated helpers that understand your GORM models.

### Who Should Use This?

GORM CLI is ideal for Go developers who:

- Build database-intensive applications with GORM
- Value early error detection and robust type-checking
- Want to accelerate development by cutting down repetitive query code
- Need flexible but safe SQL query generation embedded in Go code

## What is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a code generator that creates type-safe, interface-driven query APIs tailored for GORM projects in Go. It lets you define SQL queries declaratively inside interface method comments using SQL templates, and then outputs fully-typed Go code that integrates seamlessly with your models.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: the flexibility of writing raw SQL when you need it, with the safety and productivity of working with Go interfaces and compile-time checks.

## How Does It Work?

You define Go interfaces with method signatures representing your desired queries. Above each method, you embed SQL templates in comments using simple tags, such as `SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id`. GORM CLI parses these contracts and generates:

- Go interfaces that ensure type-safe method calls
- Structs and helper functions to map query parameters and results

This eliminates manual SQL string management and risky unchecked queries.

## Key Benefits and Unique Value

- **Interface-driven design:** APIs are easy to discover and autocomplete in IDEs.
- **SQL templates in comments:** Enables custom, powerful queries without sacrificing safety.
- **Model-aware helpers:** Generates field helpers reflecting your GORM model's structure and types.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Outputs code fully compatible with GORM’s idioms, simplifying implementation.
- **Compile-time query validation:** Catch errors early during development, not at runtime.

## Core Features & How They Help You

### 1. Interface-Driven Query APIs
Define query semantics through Go interfaces, making your data access code clean and intention-revealing. Example:

```go
// UserQuery defines user-related queries
 type UserQuery[T any] interface {
   // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
   ByID(id int) (T, error)
 }
```

This signature-style approach lets GORM CLI generate a strongly-typed `ByID` method that queries your database safely.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers
Generate Go helpers that allow safe manipulation of model fields with knowledge of types and relationships, reducing manual coding errors.

### 3. Flexible SQL Template Parsing
Write raw SQL queries with parameter placeholders inside the interface comments. GORM CLI processes these templates and generates parameter binding and query execution code.

Example SQL template:
```sql
SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
```

### 4. Robust Type Safety & Discovery
All generated methods follow Go’s type system, preventing errors like passing wrong types or missing parameters. IDEs can autocomplete methods and parameters.

### 5. Simplified Integration Configuration
Configure the CLI easily for your GORM models, and the generated code follows your setup consistently.

## Why Should You Care?

Using GORM CLI transforms how you interact with your database by:

- **Reducing Runtime Errors:** Catch query-related issues at compile time.
- **Boosting Developer Productivity:** Spend less time writing repetitive code and more time building features.
- **Improving Code Maintenance:** Interface-driven design produces readable, maintainable data access layers.
- **Enabling Custom Queries Safely:** Leverage raw SQL power without risking safety or maintainability.

### Common Use Cases

- Applications requiring complex but safe database access logic
- Projects seeking to enforce query correctness and reduce debugging time
- Teams that prefer API-driven data interaction patterns over raw SQL strings

### Before and After GORM CLI

| Before GORM CLI                           | After GORM CLI                              |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Manual SQL query strings prone to errors | Type-safe, generated query interface code  |
| Repetitive boilerplate for queries       | Clean, concise interface method declarations|
| Runtime failures due to miswritten SQL   | Compile-time validation prevents mistakes |
