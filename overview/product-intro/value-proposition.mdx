# Product Value & Benefits

Discover how GORM CLI transforms your Go projects with GORM by delivering enhanced type safety, drastically reducing repetitive code, and streamlining query construction and updates. This page explains the core benefits that empower teams to build database-driven applications faster, with greater confidence and fewer runtime errors.

---

## Unlocking Safer, Faster Development

GORM CLI is more than a code generator — it’s a productivity enhancer that helps you write cleaner, safer code by integrating seamlessly with the GORM ORM. Here’s why GORM CLI stands out:

- **Improved Type Safety**: By generating interface-driven query APIs and strongly-typed field helpers, your queries become checked at compile time. This eliminates common runtime errors due to mistyped column names or mismatched query parameters.

- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Forget manually writing repetitive SQL or GORM queries. GORM CLI auto-generates fluent APIs and helpers from your model structs and your annotated interfaces, letting you focus on business logic instead of plumbing.

- **Streamlined Queries and Updates**: Using template-based SQL in your Go interfaces, you gain powerful, flexible query construction with compile-time validation. Updates leverage model-driven setters that cleanly express intent, including updates on associations.

- **Enhanced GORM Integration**: Everything generated is designed to work cohesively with GORM, ensuring predictable, idiomatic usage alongside your existing database code.

## What Does This Mean For You?

Imagine a development workflow where your IDE helps you autocomplete SQL queries and fields tied directly to your Go models, preventing mismatches before running your application. Your team avoids bugs tied to typo errors or invalid fields, which can be costly and time-consuming to debug.

For instance, instead of manually writing:

```go
var user User
err := db.Where("name = ? AND age = ?", name, age).First(&user).Error
```

you leverage generated field helpers and query interfaces:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge(ctx, "jinzhu", 25).Find()
```

This code is:

- **Type-safe**: The compiler verifies field names and types.
- **Self-documenting**: Method names clearly express intent.
- **Less error-prone**: SQL snippets are templated and validated during code generation.

## Core Benefits Explained

### 1. Type Safety That Catches Errors Early

GORM CLI generates query interfaces and field helper structs based on your model types. This means queries referencing columns like `User.Name` or `User.Age` are strongly typed. If you rename a field or mistype a column name, the compiler immediately points it out — stopping errors before runtime.

### 2. Eliminate Boilerplate Code

Boilerplate SQL and repetitive query condition code disappears. Define your queries once as Go interface methods with SQL templates, and GORM CLI generates implementations that integrate seamlessly with `gorm.DB`.

For example, an interface method like:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

becomes:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

No manual SQL strings or query builders needed.

### 3. Fluent and Flexible Query & Update APIs

The generated field helpers — typed structs tied to your model fields — allow you to fluently build queries and perform updates.

Example:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice"), generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Update(ctx)
```

This style reduces errors, improves readability, and provides rich predicates for common database operations.

### 4. Robust Association Handling

GORM CLI also generates helpers for associations:

- `has one` and `has many`
- `belongs to`
- `many to many`

You can create, update, unlink, or delete associated entities with type safety and clear intent. For example:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This handles inserting a user and their pet in a consistent, error-checked manner.

## Real Team Impact: Faster, More Confident Releases

**Before GORM CLI**: Teams handwrite SQL or GORM queries, manually manage field names and conditions, and debug silent runtime SQL errors.

**After adopting GORM CLI**:

- Time spent writing and testing queries shrinks.
- Compile-time errors prevent many common bugs.
- Developers navigate and auto-complete generated APIs, speeding development.
- Codebases grow more maintainable with consistent query patterns.

That means faster feature release cycles, less firefighting in production, and improved developer confidence.

## Getting Started Preview

To start benefiting from these value points:

1. **Write your Go interfaces** with SQL templates for queries and updates.
2. **Define your model structs** (or use existing GORM models).
3. **Run GORM CLI code generation**, which creates typed query APIs and field helpers.
4. **Replace manual queries** with generated APIs in your code.

For detailed quick start instructions and configuration options, see the [Getting Started](https://gorm.io/docs/getting-started/introduction-setup.html) documentation.

## Tips for Maximizing Benefits

- Use the `genconfig.Config` to tailor generation for your project—control output paths, mappings, and inclusion/exclusion of interfaces or structs.
- Take advantage of template directives like `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` for dynamic queries.
- Regularly regenerate code when your models change, ensuring your queries stay in sync.
- Leverage association helpers to simplify complex relational data operations.
