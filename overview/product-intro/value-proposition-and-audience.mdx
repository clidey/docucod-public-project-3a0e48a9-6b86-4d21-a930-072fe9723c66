# Value Proposition & Target Audience

## Unlocking the Power of GORM CLI: Why You Should Care

For Go developers building data-intensive applications, the struggle to write safe, maintainable, and efficient data access code is real. GORM CLI transforms how you interact with your database by generating code that is not only type-safe but also intuitive and fluent to use.

Imagine eliminating entire categories of runtime errors caused by misspelled SQL, mismatched types, or forgotten parameters — all at compile time. GORM CLI bridges the gap between your Go models and SQL queries, creating a seamless development experience where your IDE becomes your most trusted guide.

## Core Benefits Delivered by GORM CLI

- **Compile-Time Safety**: Catch query mistakes before you ever run your code. Generated interfaces and helpers enforce type correctness, so you avoid SQL injection risks, parameter mismatches, and schema drift issues early.

- **Fluent and Discoverable APIs**: Interact with your data layer via generated Go interfaces that support autocomplete and smart suggestions. You write less glue code, making complex queries simpler and easier to maintain.

- **Rapid Code Generation**: Convert your existing Go model structs and interface-defined SQL templates into ready-to-use query APIs in moments. Accelerate development cycles with consistent, boilerplate-free code.

- **Tight Integration with GORM**: Build on top of the well-known GORM ORM ecosystem. The generated code works seamlessly alongside `gorm.io/gorm`, ensuring compatibility, stability, and familiar developer ergonomics.

## Who Benefits Most? Your Role in the Development Workflow

GORM CLI is ideal for **Go developers** focused on building robust, maintainable data access layers. Whether you are:

- Crafting **complex business logic** that requires precise, type-safe interactions with your database
- Maintaining **large codebases** where accidental regressions from raw SQL or reflection-based calls must be minimized
- Accelerating development by **automating query and helper generation**, reducing repetitive manual coding
- Integrating with the popular **GORM ORM** and want a smoother, error-resistant query layer

This tool empowers teams and individual developers who prioritize **code quality, performance, and long-term maintainability**.

## Bringing It All Together: Real-World Impact

Before using GORM CLI, developers often find themselves wrestling with string-based queries scattered across the codebase, making refactors risky and debugging slow. After adopting GORM CLI, the experience transforms into writing Go methods and querying through strong types with guaranteed correctness.

### Example Scenario:

You need to fetch users by ID and filter them by name and age. Instead of managing raw SQL strings, you define an interface with SQL templates and let GORM CLI generate a type-safe, fluent API.

```go
// Interface with templated SQL
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Fluent usage
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

This approach radically reduces maintenance burden, boosts developer confidence, and speeds up delivery.
