# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool tailored specifically for Go developers who utilize the GORM ORM library in their projects. Whether you are an individual Go developer, part of a development team, or a backend/data engineer working with Go applications, this tool is designed to seamlessly integrate and enhance your development experience.

## Unlocking Efficiency for Go Developers

If you write Go code that interacts with databases using GORM, GORM CLI streamlines your workflow by transforming your raw SQL-annotated interfaces and model structs into type-safe, expressive query APIs and field helpers. This improves code safety, clarity, and reduces the time spent writing boilerplate query code.

### Ideal Users:

- **Go Developers:** Want to generate compile-time safe, idiomatic, and fluent query APIs for GORM models.
- **Teams Using GORM:** Looking to enforce consistent, maintainable coding patterns across multiple developers and projects.
- **Backend Engineers:** Who manage complex data models and require swift generation of field helpers and queries to speed up backend logic.
- **Data Engineers:** Integrating Go-based systems with databases, benefiting from type-safe queries and association helpers.

## How GORM CLI Fits Into Your Project Lifecycle

Regardless of your project size — from small personal projects to large-scale production applications — GORM CLI integrates naturally into a modern Go development cycle:

1. **Development Start:** Define your data models and raw SQL interfaces with annotated comments inside your Go code.
2. **Code Generation:** Run GORM CLI to generate fully typed query APIs and field helpers that complement your models.
3. **Coding Efficiency:** Use the generated APIs for safer, more readable, and maintainable database operations.
4. **Iteration:** Easily update your interfaces or models and regenerate code without manual sync, keeping your data layer consistent.

Importantly, GORM CLI operates as a CLI command (`gorm gen`), fitting neatly in your existing build or CI/CD pipelines to automate generation steps.

## Understanding the User Journey

Imagine you are implementing a feature to fetch users by different criteria:

- **Before GORM CLI:** You manually write SQL queries and scan results, risking mismatches in query parameters or data types.
- **With GORM CLI:** You define an interface with raw SQL in comments and let the CLI generate concise, type-checked query methods. Your code becomes expressive and less error-prone.

Similarly, managing associations (like user pets, accounts, or languages) is tedious without tooling. GORM CLI generates association helpers that let you perform create, update, unlink, and delete actions safely and fluently — all with compile-time guarantees.

### Key Advantages for the User:

- **Type Safety:** Avoid runtime query errors with compile-time checks.
- **Ergonomic APIs:** Discoverable and fluent interfaces that align with Go idioms.
- **Speed:** Drastically reduce repetitive query and model helper code.
- **Maintainability:** Cleaner, standardized, and consistent data access logic.

## Practical Scenarios Where GORM CLI Excels

- **New Projects:** Start with interfaces and models, then generate APIs automatically from your domain design.
- **Growing Applications:** Add new query methods or model fields iteratively by updating definitions and regenerating code.
- **Team Environments:** Enforce shared query contracts and reduce merging conflicts from manual query code.
- **Complex Data Relationships:** Safely manage has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many associations.

# FAQ

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Who Should Use GORM CLI">
<Accordion title="Is this tool only for new projects?">
No, GORM CLI supports integration at any stage—from bootstrapping new projects to enhancing existing codebases by generating safe, maintainable query interfaces.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I need to write raw SQL to use GORM CLI?">
You define SQL templates as annotations in interfaces; this provides control and flexibility but you benefit from automatic binding and type-safe wrappers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will this tool slow down build times?">
Code generation occurs as a separate step via the CLI and can be integrated into builds or CI/CD without affecting runtime performance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I have to know generics in Go to use it?">
Understanding generics will help you use the generated APIs effectively, but you don't need deep expertise upfront—the tool takes care of generating generic-safe code.
