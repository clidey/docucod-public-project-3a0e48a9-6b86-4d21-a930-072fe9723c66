# Target Audience & Use Cases

GORM CLI is designed for Go developers and development teams using GORM who want to harness the power of type-safe, maintainable, and generated query APIs. This page will help you understand exactly who benefits the most from GORM CLI and uncover how it fits into your project goals and workflows.

---

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

### Go Developers Leveraging GORM
If you write Go applications that depend on GORM for database operations, GORM CLI significantly improves your development experience by generating strongly typed query methods and field helpers. It eliminates repetitive boilerplate, reduces runtime errors, and makes your queries discoverable and expressive.

### Teams Prioritizing Maintainability and Safety
Projects that value long-term maintainability and robust code benefit from the compile-time safety GORM CLI brings. By generating interfaces and helpers based on your models and SQL templates, the tool helps you write safer, more reliable database access code, which scales well in larger codebases and teams.

### Greenfield Projects and Legacy Migrations
Whether building a new application from scratch or refactoring an existing one with legacy SQL queries or MVC patterns, GORM CLI streamlines migration by generating a fluent, consistent query API from annotated interfaces and models. This is ideal for quickly bringing legacy code under type-safe control or scaffolding new database layers efficiently.

---

## Why Should You Care?

GORM CLI isn’t just a code generator—it transforms the way you interact with your database models in Go, offering:

- **Type safety:** Avoid runtime query mistakes by leveraging Go’s compiler to check your query methods.
- **Reduced boilerplate:** Automatically scaffold query APIs and field helpers from your SQL-annotated interfaces and GORM models.
- **Improved productivity:** Smooth onboarding for new team members with generated, self-descriptive query interfaces.
- **Consistency:** Create a uniform, discoverable API surface that encourages best practices and reduces ad-hoc queries.

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Generating Type-Safe Query APIs from Interface Definitions
Define raw SQL queries as Go interface methods with embedded SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI turns these into fully typed, fluent APIs, eliminating manual SQL preparations and error-prone string formatting.

```go
// Define interface with SQL templates
 type Query[T any] interface {
   // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
   GetByID(id int) (T, error)
 }

// Generate code using CLI
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated

// Use generated API
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

### 2. Automating Field Helper Generation for Models
Generate strongly typed field helpers that cover basic model fields and associations for filters, updates, and ordering, ensuring compile-time checks and method discovery.

```go
// Model with associations
 type User struct {
   ID      uint
   Name    string
   Pets    []*Pet
 }

// Use generated helpers
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice"))
  .Set(generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")))
  .Create(ctx)
```

### 3. Managing Complex Associations with Compile-Time Safety
Operate on various association types—has one, has many, belongs to, many-to-many—with generated helpers that precisely model the expected operations like Create, Update, Unlink, and Delete.

### 4. Enforcing Query Consistency in Large Teams
Encourage consistent query definition and use by centralizing raw SQL in interfaces and generating corresponding implementation code, minimizing divergence and unsafe query constructs.

## Before and After GORM CLI Adoption

| Scenario             | Without GORM CLI                                    | With GORM CLI                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Writing Queries      | Manual SQL strings prone to injection and errors | Interface-based SQL templates with generated safety |
| Handling Models       | Handwritten field helpers and association logic  | Generated, type-checked field helpers covering fields and associations |
| Onboarding New Devs   | Steep learning curve reading raw SQL and conventions | Self-documenting, discoverable query interfaces |
| Maintenance           | Ad-hoc, inconsistent database access scattered through code | Unified, maintainable query APIs with compile-time validation |

## Getting Started Preview

Getting started with GORM CLI is straightforward:

- **Define your query interfaces and models:** Write Go interfaces with SQL templates in comments alongside your GORM models.
- **Run the generator:** Use the CLI command `gorm gen` specifying input path and output directory.
- **Integrate generated code:** Use the generated query APIs and field helpers in your application code for type-safe, fluent database operations.

For detailed steps, see the [Quickstart Workflow](./quickstart) and [Define Models & Query Interfaces](../../getting-started/first-generation/define-models-interfaces) documentation.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Annotate interfaces carefully:** Use the supported SQL templating DSL to maximize generation capabilities.
- **Leverage configuration:** Use `genconfig.Config` to include/exclude files, map field types, and customize output paths.
- **Test generated code:** Validate generated APIs early in your CI to catch potential template or typing issues.
- **Use associations helpers:** Embrace generated association methods for safer and clearer relation handling.
