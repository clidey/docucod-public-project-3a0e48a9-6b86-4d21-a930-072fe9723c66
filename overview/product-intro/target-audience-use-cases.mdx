# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Unlocking Robust, Maintainable, and Type-Safe Data Layers for Go Developers Using GORM

GORM CLI is meticulously crafted for Go developers who rely on GORM and demand a data access layer that is not only reliable but also maintainable and type-safe. If you are building business-critical applications where data queries must be precise, filters must be maintainable, and associations must be handled with confidence, this page clarifies why GORM CLI is your indispensable tool.

---

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed with a clear focus on developers and development teams working with GORM in Go projects. Here is why you should care:

- **Go Developers Utilizing GORM**: If you're writing business logic in Go that interacts with relational databases via GORM, and you want to avoid the pitfalls of dynamic or unsafe queries, this applies to you.
- **Teams Building Enterprise APIs and CRUD Backends**: Where consistency and type safety guarantee fewer runtime errors and clearer contracts.
- **Data-Intensive Applications**: Analytics engines, reporting systems, or any application managing complex data relationships demand a strong, maintainable query API.
- **Developers Seeking Maintainability**: When your project scales, maintaining ad-hoc queries becomes a nightmare—GORM CLI structures your data layer with generated, reusable, and strongly-typed code.

By choosing GORM CLI, you reduce bugs, improve compile-time safety, and save development time with a fluent, discoverable API for database operations.

## Why GORM CLI for Your Use Cases?

At the core, GORM CLI seamlessly bridges the gap between your Go code and your database operations by generating:

- **Type-Safe Query APIs**: Convert Go interfaces with SQL annotations into concrete, type-checked query implementations. Say goodbye to string-based query errors.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: Generate strongly typed field and association helpers from your model structs to build and maintain filters, updates, and joins effortlessly.

This empowers you to:

- Write expressive, safe, and reusable queries backed by compile-time guarantees.
- Abstract complex query logic behind simple, interface-driven methods.
- Manage associations — such as has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many — with dedicated, type-safe helpers.
- Configure and customize code generation precisely to your project’s needs.

## Common Use Cases Where GORM CLI Excels

### 1. **CRUD Backends**
Manage create, read, update, and delete operations through clean, well-typed generated APIs that eliminate boilerplate and runtime errors.

### 2. **Enterprise APIs**
Develop large-scale APIs that require consistent and maintainable data access layers with strong typing and clear method contracts.

### 3. **Analytics and Reporting Engines**
Construct complex filtering and querying criteria with model-driven field helpers and interface-based query methods for robust data analysis.

### 4. **Handling Complex Associations**
With built-in support for association operations like create, update, unlink, delete, and batch create, you can manipulate related data safely and concisely.

### 5. **Maintaining Large Codebases**
Filter and exclude specific models or interfaces from generation to keep your codebase focused, maintainable, and clean.

## Experience Before and After GORM CLI

| Without GORM CLI                                     | With GORM CLI                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Writing raw SQL strings prone to typos and errors  | Interface-driven methods with compile-time checks    |
| Manually crafting filters and query conditions     | Fluent generated field helpers for reusable filters  |
| Handling associations manually and repetitively    | Dedicated association helpers with built-in semantics|
| Time-consuming debugging and update cycles         | Faster development cycles with fewer runtime bugs     |

## Tips for Maximizing GORM CLI Benefits

- **Start with your domain models**: Define your structs clearly, including associations. The generator crafts powerful helpers based on these.
- **Write query interfaces with SQL templates**: Annotate methods with SQL snippets, letting GORM CLI generate type-safe implementations.
- **Configure generation wisely**: Use `genconfig.Config` for fine-grained control over which interfaces or structs to include or exclude.
- **Leverage association helpers**: Use `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, and `Delete` operations to keep related data consistent without tedious manual code.

### Example Scenario: Building a CRUD API for Users

Imagine you are building an application with a `User` model having fields like `ID`, `Name`, `Age`, and associated `Pets`. You want to:

- Fetch users safely by ID
- Filter users by dynamic conditions
- Create and update users along with their pets

With GORM CLI, you start by defining a query interface with methods annotating the SQL logic. The tool generates a type-safe API alongside field helpers.

This approach eliminates common errors during query construction and association handling, accelerates development, and ensures your backend code stays maintainable and scalable.

```go
// User query interface with templated SQL
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Pets association helpers allow create, update, unlink, and delete operations
User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")).
```

By understanding your project needs and leveraging GORM CLI’s generated, type-safe, and maintainable data access layers, you transform the way you manage Go database interactions—building robust systems faster and with greater confidence.
