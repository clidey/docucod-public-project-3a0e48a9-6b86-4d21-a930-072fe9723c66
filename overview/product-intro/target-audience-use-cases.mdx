# Target Audience & Typical Use Cases

## Unlocking Efficiency for Go Developers and Backend Teams

GORM CLI empowers Go developers and teams building backend systems with a powerful code generation tool designed to bring compile-time safety, maintainability, and fluent APIs to their data layer.

Whether you are rapidly prototyping APIs, scaling a large service, or enforcing strict code quality standards, this page clarifies exactly who benefits most from GORM CLI and highlights scenarios where it delivers exceptional value.

---

## Who Gains the Most from GORM CLI?

- **Go Developers working with GORM**: Individuals coding in Go who use or plan to adopt GORM for ORM-driven database access and want to enhance their productivity with automated code generation.

- **Backend Teams Building Scalable Services**: Teams managing large codebases where type safety, maintainable query definitions, and consistent field helpers can reduce bugs and onboarding friction.

- **Engineering Leads & Architects**: Professionals looking to enforce static safety at the data access layer and establish predictable, fluent query APIs.

- **API Designers & Prototypers**: Developers who want to rapidly define data access interfaces using expressive SQL templates and generate type-safe, discoverable query methods.

- **Projects Emphasizing Long-term Maintainability**: Systems requiring clean, coverable, and extensible data access layers that benefit from generated code visibility and compile-time correctness.

## High-Value Use Cases

### 1. Rapid API Prototyping With Type Safety

GORM CLI lets you define your database queries as simple Go interfaces annotated with inline SQL templates. From these, it generates fully type-safe, strongly-typed query APIs.

*Example Scenario:* You need to quickly implement a user data access layer with custom filtering logic. Instead of writing raw SQL or manual query builders, you declare your `Query[T]` interface methods with annotated SQL, then run the CLI to instantly have tested, type-checked query methods.

This approach accelerates development by combining SQL expressiveness with Go’s static type checks.

### 2. Large-Scale Backend Development

For backend services managing complex domain models and relationships, manually maintaining query and data access code is error-prone.

GORM CLI’s model-driven field helpers provide fluent, discoverable field predicates, setters, and association operations. This reduces boilerplate and prevents common bugs like mismatched column names or unsafe casts.

*Real-World Example:* In multi-team projects, the generated field helpers ensure everyone uses the same consistent API for updates, filters, and associations, fostering code uniformity and reducing code review burdens.

### 3. Enforcing Stricter Code Quality and Static Safety

Unlike traditional ORM usage which might rely heavily on string-based queries, GORM CLI enforces compile-time verification of signatures and SQL bindings.

You get:
- Parameter binding checked against method signatures.
- Validation that generated methods return appropriate types and errors.
- Compile-time detection of missing or mismatched query parameters.

This dramatically lowers runtime errors and unexpected query misbehavior.

### 4. Maintainnable Data Layers With Clear Separation

By generating code based on declarative query interfaces and structs, your architecture gains a clear separation of concerns:
- Define what queries do at the interface level.
- Keep models and business logic separated.
- Generate consistent query implementations that fit seamlessly in your repository or service layers.

This makes refactoring and testing more straightforward.

### 5. Complex Association Operations

GORM CLI's companion field helpers support safe, idiomatic association management for has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many relationships.

You can confidently perform create, update, unlink, and delete operations on associations without manually writing unsafe or repetitive code.

*Example:* Create a new user along with multiple related pets and languages using fluent chained setter calls, improving code clarity and reducing error risk.

## Practical Tips for Teams Considering GORM CLI

- Start by defining your core query interfaces and model structs.
- Use SQL templates in interface comments to express custom queries clearly.
- Leverage generated field helpers to reduce repetitive filter and update code.
- Integrate generated APIs gradually into existing GORM usage for smooth migration.
- Use generation configurations to include or exclude interfaces and structs based on your project needs.
