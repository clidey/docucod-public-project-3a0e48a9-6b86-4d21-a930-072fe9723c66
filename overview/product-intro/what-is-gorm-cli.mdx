# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe and Discoverable GORM APIs from Your Go Code

GORM CLI is a powerful command-line tool designed to transform your Go interfaces and model structs into fully typed, fluent, and discoverable GORM APIs. This generation process automates boilerplate code, enforces compile-time safety for queries and updates, and simplifies working with complex filters and associations in your database layer.

Driven by your Go source code, GORM CLI effortlessly integrates into your project's workflow, helping you write less repetitive code while gaining confidence in data access correctness.

---

## Introducing GORM CLI: What It Does and Why It Matters

At its core, GORM CLI converts two key elements in your codebase into safe, reusable components:

- **Query Interfaces:** Write raw SQL templates as Go interface method comments, and GORM CLI generates type-safe, concrete methods that seamlessly integrate with GORM’s query builder.
- **Model Struct Field Helpers:** From your Go model structs, it creates strongly typed field helpers used for filters, updates, ordering, and sophisticated association management.

Together, these outputs eliminate the risks and tedium of hand-crafting SQL queries and manual code for filtering or associating related data.

With GORM CLI, you gain:

- **Compile-Time Type Safety:** Avoid runtime errors by catching mistakes early in your IDE or build process.
- **Fully Discoverable APIs:** Leverage IntelliSense and autocomplete for faster, more accurate code.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Your generated code works naturally with GORM’s core features.
- **Automation of Repetitive Code:** Save significant development time by automating tedious, error-prone boilerplate.

---

## What Problems Does GORM CLI Solve?

Developers often face challenges managing large database interaction layers:

- Writing complex SQL queries inline or string building is error-prone and difficult to maintain.
- Manually coding filter helpers or association logic leads to inconsistencies and duplications.
- Lack of compile-time checks results in runtime query failures or subtle bugs.

GORM CLI empowers you to centralize query definitions as interfaces with embedded SQL comments, and generate models that enforce consistent typing and safe association operations.

### How GORM CLI Enables You:

- Define your desired queries declaratively in Go interfaces with SQL templates.
- Automate generating Go code that implements these queries with context-aware parameters.
- Rapidly access and manipulate model fields and relationships using generated field helpers rather than manual SQL.

This approach delivers long-term maintainability, robust code quality, and accelerated development.

---

## How Does GORM CLI Work?

While the internal implementation is intricate, the user-facing workflow is refreshingly simple:

1. **Declare Your Query Interfaces:** Define Go interfaces where each method includes an SQL query template in its comment.
2. **Write Your Models:** Model structs represent your database tables.
3. **Run the CLI Command:** Use `gorm gen` with input paths to your interface and model files.
4. **Use the Generated Code:** Import and use fully typed query implementations and field helpers directly in your application.

This flow integrates effortlessly into your build or development process.

---

## Real-World Example

Imagine a `User` model and a `Query` interface:

```go
// Query interface with embedded SQL templates
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE name=@name AND age > @minAge
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, minAge int) ([]T, error)
}

// User model
type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

Running `gorm gen -i ./models -o ./generated` generates:

- `Query[User]` methods with type-safe parameters and returns.
- `User` field helpers for filters (`User.Name.Eq(...)`, `User.Age.Gt(...)`).

You can then query your database with confidence:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge(ctx, "jinzhu", 20)
```

## Summary of Key Value Propositions

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Prevent runtime errors with interface-driven, code-generated queries.
- **Model-Driven Helpers:** Fluent, discoverable field and association helpers based on your model definitions.
- **Automated Code Generation:** Accelerate development by automating repetitive database code.
- **Seamless GORM Compatibility:** Effortlessly plugs into the popular GORM ORM framework.
- **Flexible Template DSL:** Expressive SQL templating with placeholders, conditionals, loops, and dynamic clauses.

---

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

- Go developers building applications with GORM needing advanced, type-safe database interactions.
- Teams seeking to reduce boilerplate and enforce correctness in query implementations.
- Projects with complex models and associations that require maintainable, fluent data layer APIs.

---

## Getting Started

To begin using GORM CLI, you'll want to:

1. Write Go interfaces with method comments containing SQL templates.
2. Create corresponding Go model structs.
3. Run `gorm gen` with proper input and output paths.
4. Import and use the generated code in your application.

For detailed guidance, explore the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements) and [Quickstart Workflow](./overview/quick-features/quickstart).

---

## Tips for Success

- Always include context parameters (`ctx context.Context`) in your interface methods for proper query cancellation and tracing support.
- Use the rich template DSL directives to craft dynamic SQL safely and expressively.
- Leverage generation config files (`genconfig.Config`) for customization such as type mapping and file inclusion/exclusion.
- Regularly run code generation during development to keep generated code in sync.

Leveraging GORM CLI transforms your Go & GORM development experience, giving you clear, type-checked access to your data layer while slashing manual boilerplate. Start defining your queries and models clearly, and let GORM CLI generate the safe, fluent APIs for you.
