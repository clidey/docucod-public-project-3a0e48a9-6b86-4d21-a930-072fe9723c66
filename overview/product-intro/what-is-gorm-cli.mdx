# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Seamless, Compile-Time Safe Query APIs for Your GORM Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful code generator designed specifically for GORM projects that transforms your Go interfaces and model structs into polished, type-safe query APIs and intuitive model-driven field helpers. With GORM CLI, your Go applications gain a discoverable, fluent API for interacting with databases — enabling you to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.

---

## Introduction

At its core, GORM CLI is a command-line tool that reads your Go source code — including interfaces annotated with SQL templates and your GORM model structs — and then generates corresponding type-safe query methods and field helpers. These generated APIs allow you to write database queries with confidence, benefiting from strong typing, improved maintainability, and flawless integration with GORM in your applications.

### Why GORM CLI?

Manually crafting query code can be error-prone and tedious. GORM CLI solves this by automatically generating:

- **Interface-driven Type-Safe Query APIs**: Write Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates, and GORM CLI generates concrete implementations that guarantee type safety and correctness.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: From your model structs, it creates rich field helpers that simplify building filters, updates, ordering clauses, and managing associations.

Together, these features save you development time, reduce bugs, and provide an expressive, idiomatic Go interface for querying your database.

---

## What Does GORM CLI Generate and How Does It Work?

1. **Write Query Interfaces:** Define Go interfaces in your source code that encapsulate your database queries using declarative SQL templates embedded in comments.

2. **Define Models:** Use your existing GORM model structs or define new ones that represent your database tables.

3. **Run GORM CLI Generator:** GORM CLI scans your interfaces and models — either from a specific file or an entire directory — and generates ready-to-use query APIs and field helpers into a designated output directory.

4. **Use Generated Code:** Incorporate the generated code seamlessly into your application to perform strongly-typed queries and data modifications.

---

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Type Safety at Compile Time:** Errors such as column typos or mismatched types are detected early.
- **Flexible, Template-Driven Queries:** Write SQL fragments using an intuitive templating DSL with placeholders and conditional clauses.
- **Powerful Field Helpers:** Easily build predicates and updates without manual SQL.
- **Association Operations Support:** Create, update, unlink, or delete related entities with simple API calls that understand relationships.
- **Configurable and Extendable:** Customize generation with package-level config files.
- **Smooth GORM Integration:** Uses idiomatic gorm.io/gorm APIs so generated code integrates naturally.

---

## Example Workflow

### Define a Query Interface and Models

```go
// examples/query.go

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

### Generate Code

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

### Use Generated APIs

```go
// Query user by ID
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Filter users with age > 18
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)
```

## Understanding the Core Features

### 1. Interface-Driven Type-Safe Query APIs

Define your queries declaratively as Go interfaces with SQL templates embedded in comments. These templates use placeholders (`@@table`, `@param`) and conditional logic (`{{if}}`, `{{where}}`) that the generator resolves.

This generates concrete methods that build and execute the corresponding SQL queries, ensuring parameter binding and syntax correctness at compile time.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers

From your GORM model structs, GORM CLI generates field helpers for every basic field and association. These helpers provide fluent predicate builders (e.g., `.Eq()`, `.Like()`, `.Between()`) to construct complex WHERE clauses and update expressions.

### 3. Association Operations

Support for complex association management is built-in:

- **Create** and **CreateInBatch** to insert and link related entities.
- **Update** to modify associated rows.
- **Unlink** to remove links without deleting data.
- **Delete** to remove associated rows or join entries.

### 4. SQL Template DSL

GORM CLI supports a rich templating system allowing dynamic query construction with directives:

| Directive | Purpose                     | Example                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `@@table` | Model's table name binding  | `SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id` |
| `@param`  | SQL parameter binding       | `WHERE name=@user.Name`         |
| `{{where}}` | Conditional WHERE clause     | `{{where}} age > 18 {{end}}`     |
| `{{set}}` | Conditional SET clause       | `{{set}} name=@name {{end}}`    |

## Practical Usage Scenarios

- Building robust repository layers with type-safe queries, avoiding runtime SQL errors.
- Writing complex filters and updates without manual SQL concatenation.
- Managing entity relations (belongs to, has many, many2many) safely and efficiently.
- Extending projects with custom field types (e.g., JSON columns via field helpers).
- Generating code tailored to subsets of your model/interfaces using configuration.

## Getting Started Preview

The typical path to adopt GORM CLI:

1. Define or identify your GORM models and write query interface(s) with SQL templates.
2. Install GORM CLI (Go 1.18+ required):

   ```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

3. Run the generator pointing to your source interface and specifying the output folder.
4. Consume the generated typed APIs within your Go applications.
