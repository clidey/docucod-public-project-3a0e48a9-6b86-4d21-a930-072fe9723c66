# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlocking Compile-Time Safe, Fluent Query APIs for GORM-Based Go Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed specifically for Go developers leveraging the GORM ORM. It transforms your Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates and your model structs into strongly typed, interface-driven query APIs and convenient field helpers. This generation process delivers complete compile-time safety and greatly improves developer productivity through fluent and discoverable APIs tailored for both read and write operations.

---

### Why GORM CLI Matters to You

Imagine writing database queries without fearing runtime errors caused by mismatched types or misspelled fields. GORM CLI automates the creation of query methods and field helpers that render raw SQL into type-safe Go code. You no longer need to manually maintain brittle SQL query strings scattered throughout your codebase.

Instead, define your querying logic as plain Go interfaces coupled with intuitive SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI generates implementation-ready code that seamlessly integrates with GORM. This gives you:

- **Safety:** Errors in queries surface during compilation, not at runtime
- **Intuitiveness:** Autocomplete-friendly APIs guide you through method and field names
- **Efficiency:** Less boilerplate and fewer bugs, so you can focus on business logic

---

## What Exactly Is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a command-line tool (`gorm gen`) that scans Go interface files annotated with SQL templates and your model structs. It then generates two complementary codebases:

1. **Interface-Driven Query APIs**: Concrete implementations of your interfaces producing fluent and type-safe querying methods.
2. **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: Typed helpers for fields and associations enabling filters, setters, update operations, and more.

This split empowers you to write declarative SQL-like logic in your interfaces while benefiting from strongly typed, chainable Go methods under the hood.

## Core Value Proposition

| Aspect                      | Benefit                                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compile-Time Safety          | Catch errors like wrong return types or missing parameters early
| Fluent, Discoverable APIs   | Intuitive methods and chainable query/association helpers
| Reduced Boilerplate          | Eliminate manual implementation of queries and bindings
| Integration with GORM        | Compatible with existing GORM workflows and conventions


This means you confidently harness SQL querying power with the reliability and ergonomics of idiomatic Go code.

## How GORM CLI Works at a High Level

At its core, `gorm gen` parses your Go source files to extract interface definitions and Go structs:

- It analyzes the comments of interface methods containing SQL templates.
- It uses Go's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing to understand method signatures and struct field types.
- It applies configurable mappings and filters to tailor generated code.

Armed with this information, it generates:

- Implementation structs that fulfill your query interfaces with method bodies leveraging GORM's builder.
- Field helper variables attached to your models for constructing filters and updates with type safety.

You operate `gorm gen` from the CLI, specifying input interface files and output directory. The generated code integrates smoothly into your project.

## A Concrete Example

Given this interface:

```go
// Query interface with SQL template in comment
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

GORM CLI generates a method such as:

```go
func (e _QueryInterfaceImpl[T]) GetByID(ctx context.Context, id int) (T, error) {
    sqlSnippet := `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=?`
    return e.Exec(ctx, sqlSnippet, id)
}
```

And for models, it produces field helpers like:

```go
var User = struct {
    ID field.Number[int]
    Name field.String
    Age field.Number[int]
}{
    ID: field.Number[int]{}.WithColumn("id"),
    Name: field.String{}.WithColumn("name"),
    Age: field.Number[int]{}.WithColumn("age"),
}
```

This enables fluent and safe query building options:

```go
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge(ctx, "alice", 30)
err = gorm.G[User](db).Where(User.Age.Gt(18)).Update(ctx)
```

## Getting Started with GORM CLI

1. **Define Your Interfaces**: Write Go interfaces annotating methods with SQL templates.
2. **Annotate Models**: Use your GORM model structs in the same package or folder.
3. **Run Code Generation**:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

4. **Use Generated APIs**: Import and call generated query APIs and field helpers from your code.

---

### Practical Tips

- **Always provide context.Context as the first parameter for generated methods.** The generator auto-injects it if omitted.
- **Use configurable package-level `genconfig.Config` for advanced customization.**
- **Place interfaces and models in the same directory to simplify generation.**
- **Named field helpers support clear, chainable syntax for common predicates and update operations.**

## Summary

GORM CLI transforms raw Go interfaces and models into robust, type-safe, and elegant query APIs that integrate seamlessly with GORM. By leveraging compile-time verification and fluent helper methods, it empowers Go developers to write clearer, safer, and more maintainable database access code.

Explore its power for yourself by defining your interfaces today and generating your comprehensive query toolkit with a single command.
