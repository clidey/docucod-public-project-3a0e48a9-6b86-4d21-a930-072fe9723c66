# What is GORM CLI?

## Introducing GORM CLI: Empowering Go Developers with Type-Safe Query Generation

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool crafted specifically for Go developers working with the GORM ORM framework. It generates type-safe query APIs and strongly typed field helpers by analyzing your Go interfaces and model structs. By enforcing compile-time safety and providing a fluent, discoverable API, GORM CLI transforms how you interact with your database—making both simple and complex data operations safer, clearer, and more intuitive.

---

## Unlocking Safe and Fluent Database Interactions

At its core, GORM CLI bridges the gap between your data model and query logic. Instead of writing potentially error-prone raw SQL or hand-crafted queries, you define interfaces annotated with SQL templates and your database models in Go structs. From these, GORM CLI generates concrete implementations that integrate seamlessly with GORM’s query builder.

This approach:
- Ensures **compile-time type safety**, dramatically reducing runtime SQL errors.
- Delivers a **fluent, discoverable API** for queries and updates.
- Simplifies complex query building with **method chaining** based on generated interfaces.

With GORM CLI, every interaction with your database is backed by the tooling that understands your data model deeply, enabling faster development and more maintainable code.

## How GORM CLI Works: From Interfaces to Type-Safe Code

GORM CLI processes your Go source files or directories containing interfaces and models. It parses interface methods that include SQL template comments and model structs with their fields and associations. Using this information, it generates two complementary sets of code:

1. **Type-Safe Query APIs**: Concrete implementations of your query interfaces, with SQL execution wired in, supporting:
   - Strongly typed method signatures.
   - Context parameter auto-injection for concurrency and cancellations.
   - Fluent chaining and execution methods.

2. **Field & Association Helpers**: Strongly typed field descriptors to build filters, updates, and association operations in a type-safe manner, supporting:
   - Basic fields (ints, strings, bools, floats, time, bytes).
   - Named types implementing Scanner, Valuer, or GORM’s Serializer interfaces.
   - Association operations like Create, Update, Unlink, Delete for `has one`, `has many`, `belongs to`, and `many2many` relationships.

By generating all these from your interfaces and models, GORM CLI eliminates repetitive boilerplate and prevents common errors tied to manual query construction.

## Key Features & Benefits

### 1. Compile-Time Safety
- Methods generated mirror your query interface signatures.
- Return types and parameters are strongly typed, catching invalid queries early.

### 2. Fluent, Discoverable API
- Methods return query interface implementations, enabling chaining and clear pattern flows.
- Field helpers provide expressive predicates and setters (`Eq`, `Like`, `Between`, `Set`, `Incr`, etc.).

### 3. Model-Driven Field & Association Helpers
- Helpers generated from your struct fields include support for complex relations and embedded types.
- Association helpers support batch operations and filtered modifications.

### 4. Configurable Generation
- Fine-grained control over target output directory, included/excluded interfaces or structs via `genconfig.Config`.
- Map custom field names or types to custom helpers (e.g., JSON columns).

### 5. SQL Template DSL Support
- Supports advanced template directives: `@@table`, `@@column`, `@param` mapping, conditional `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` blocks, iterations, and conditional logic.
- Enables writing expressive, maintainable SQL within Go interface comments.

## Real-World Scenario: Simplifying User Queries

Imagine you have a `User` model with various fields and associations, and a `Query[T]` interface defining methods for filtering and retrieving users via annotated SQL. By running GORM CLI on your source directory:

- You get a generated `Query[User]` implementation that safely accepts parameters and runs optimized SQL.
- You use generated field helpers like `generated.User.Name.Eq("Alice")` to build filters with compile-time safety.
- Your code becomes free from raw string SQL errors and tedious manual queries.

Example usage:

```go
// Type-safe GetByID query
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Fluent filtering by name and age
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge("jinzhu", 25).Find(ctx)

// Updating a user with dynamic SQL
err := generated.Query[User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, User{Name: "jinzhu", Age: 20}, 1)
```

This workflow accelerates development and increases confidence when working with complex data.

## Getting Started Preview

To start using the GORM CLI generator:

1. **Prepare your interfaces and models** in Go source files. Annotate interface methods with SQL templates in comments.
2. **Run the CLI command:**

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./path/to/generated
```

3. **Import and use the generated code** in your Go application, enjoying type-safe queries and field helpers.

Refer to the documentation on configuration, advanced SQL templates, and association handling to fully leverage GORM CLI.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use clear interface method names**; your queries become self-documenting.
- **Leverage the SQL template DSL** to handle conditional queries and complex SQL safely.
- **Configure generation selectively** using `genconfig.Config` to include or exclude specific interfaces or models.
- **Utilize association helpers** to manage related entities without custom SQL.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Ensure Go version 1.18 or higher for generics support.
- Confirm your interfaces have properly formatted SQL comments; otherwise, generation may fail.
- Validate that your models use exported fields for field helper generation.
- Use verbose CLI output to understand processing steps if generation does not produce expected files.

By introducing GORM CLI into your Go projects, you harness the power of type safety, fluent APIs, and automated boilerplate generation—transforming your data access layer into a robust, reliable foundation.
