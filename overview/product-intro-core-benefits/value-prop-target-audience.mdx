# Value Proposition & Target Audience

Discover who benefits most from GORM CLI and why it can become an indispensable tool in your Go development toolkit. This page explores the core groups of users who gain the highest value from the product and highlights practical use cases that demonstrate its impact.

## Why GORM CLI Matters to You

As a Go developer working with databases, you know that managing SQL can quickly become complex, error-prone, and cumbersome to maintain. GORM CLI addresses these challenges head-on by generating type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-based field helpers that:

- Eliminate common runtime SQL errors through compile-time verification
- Minimize repetitive SQL boilerplate, helping you write cleaner, more maintainable code
- Provide a fluent, discoverable API for all your database reads and writes

Whether you are working solo on a small project or part of a large enterprise team building complex applications, GORM CLI empowers you to write safe, maintainable, and efficient database access code.

## Who Benefits Most

### 1. Go Developers Seeking Type Safety and Maintainability

If you write raw SQL or rely heavily on string-based queries, you face the constant risk of typos, mismatched columns, or subtle logic errors that only appear at runtime. GORM CLI converts your Go model structs and query interface definitions (with SQL templates) into type-safe code:

- **Compile-time checks** catch mistakes before your code runs.
- **Strongly typed APIs** improve code completion and reduce guesswork.
- It supports complex queries with parameters, conditionals, and dynamic columns.

> *Scenario:* You create a query interface method to fetch users by ID. GORM CLI generates a method that guarantees the ID parameter and returned data model types align perfectly, preventing broken queries before deployment.

### 2. Teams Aiming to Reduce SQL Boilerplate and Runtime Errors

Teams building enterprise applications appreciate the productivity and reliability gains from a unified query API:

- **Shared interfaces reduce duplicated SQL snippets and unstructured query logic.**
- **Centralized generated helpers enable consistent filtering, updating, and association handling.**
- **Powerful association operations** (like Create, Update, Unlink, Delete) on related models come with type safety.

> *Scenario:* Your team manages a large domain model with many associations (has one/many, belongs to, many2many). GORM CLI helps by auto-generating helpers that make linked data operations intuitive and safe, reducing bugs from manual foreign key management.

### 3. Enterprise Applications Requiring Strict Type and Query Safety

With complex data flows and regulatory concerns, enterprises need guarantees that their database access logic is auditable and correct. GORM CLI’s interface-driven design and SQL templating DSL enable:

- **Expressive query definitions with dynamic WHERE/SET clauses supporting conditionals and iteration.**
- **Integration with GORM for seamless database connectivity and ORM features.**
- **Customization through generation configuration to align with team standards.**

> *Scenario:* Your organization mandates that all database queries adhere to specific patterns with audit logging. Writing queries as interfaces with embedded SQL templates ensures conformity and traceability.

### 4. Smaller Projects Seeking Productivity Without Sacrificing Safety

Even for smaller codebases, the overhead of writing and debugging raw SQL can be eliminated by adopting GORM CLI:

- Start quickly by writing simple query interfaces and models.
- Generate helpers that grow with your project.
- Maintain high code quality without manual checks.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Basic CRUD Operations:** Generate query APIs and field helpers for reads, inserts, updates, and deletes with compile-time type checking.
- **Complex Associations:** Safely create, update, unlink, or delete related data using generated association helpers.
- **Dynamic Querying:** Define interfaces with flexible SQL templates that respect parameters, conditionals, and loops to cover varied scenarios.
- **Batch Operations:** Efficiently batch create or link many-to-many relations.
- **Custom Field Handling:** Support special field types like JSON or nullable SQL fields with custom helper mappings.

## Before and After GORM CLI Adoption

| Without GORM CLI                           | With GORM CLI                            |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Manual SQL prone to typo and syntax bugs | Compile-time type checking eliminates errors |
| Repeated raw SQL strings across codebase | Central interface-driven queries and helpers |
| Complex association logic written manually | Auto-generated association helpers simplify linked data operations |
| Difficult to maintain evolving queries  | SQL templates with conditionals and loops ensure flexibility |

---

## Getting Started with Your Team

Getting started is straightforward:

1. Define your Go model structs.
2. Write query interfaces with embedded SQL templates.
3. Run GORM CLI to generate typed query APIs and field helpers.
4. Use the generated code to interact with your database safely and fluently.

See the [Quickstart & Typical Workflow](overview/real-world-integration-use-cases/quickstart-and-workflow-overview) page to dive into the workflow.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Adopt progressively:** Start with core models and queries, then expand interfaces as your project grows.
- **Leverage generation config:** Customize field helper mappings and control which interfaces and structs are included/excluded.
- **Use interface-driven queries for sharing:** Define your queries as interfaces to promote reuse across services.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t write raw SQL scattered across code—centralize in query interfaces.
- Avoid mixing query logic and business logic; keep SQL template methods focused and separate.
- Ensure your models are properly defined with relations, so association helpers are generated correctly.
