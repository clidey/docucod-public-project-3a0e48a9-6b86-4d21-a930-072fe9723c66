# Feature Summary

Discover GORM CLI's powerful dual-generation capabilities through this focused feature walkthrough. This page highlights how GORM CLI creates two complementary code outputs to boost your productivity and ensure type safety in your Go applications working with GORM.

---

## Unlocking Dual-Generation

GORM CLI generates two core sets of code that work together to deliver compile-time safety and reduce repetitive boilerplate:

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Derived from Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates, these APIs empower you with intuitive, strongly-typed database querying methods.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Extracted from your Go model structs, these helpers enable expressive, fluent construction of filters, updates, and association operations.

Each generator addresses distinct developer needs and combined, they open up robust workflows for working with your database.

---

## What Problems Does Each Generator Solve?

- **Query API Generator:**
  - Transforms Go interface method signatures plus embedded SQL templates into concrete, strongly-typed query methods.
  - Eliminates fragile raw SQL strings scattered in code by centralizing SQL templates.
  - Helps you write efficient, composable queries with context-aware method parameters.

- **Field Helper Generator:**
  - Produces strongly-typed field helpers reflecting your model's fields and associations.
  - Makes building predicates and updates safer and discoverable with method chaining and pre-built expressions.
  - Supports complex association operations like creation, batch linking, unlinking, and deletion with compile-time validation.

Together, they close gaps between your data model, query intent, and safe database interaction.

## Core Workflow Unlocks

### Query API from Interfaces with SQL Templates

Write Go interfaces that define your database queries with inline SQL templates in method comments. GORM CLI generates fully implemented type-safe methods matching your interface.

```go
// UserQuery interface example
// Contains SQL templates for user queries

// GET user by id
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// FILTER users by name and age
// WHERE name=@name AND age=@age
FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
```

This approach:
- Lets you customize raw SQL with placeholders bound to method parameters.
- Automatically injects `context.Context` if missing.
- Returns typed results or propagates errors, ensuring robust error handling.

### Model-Driven Field Helpers for Safer DB Operations

From your Go structs, GORM CLI generates field helpers enabling fluent expressions like filtering and updates.

Example with a `User` model:

```go
// Filter predicate example
generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)       // age BETWEEN 18 AND 65

// Update example with setters
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")).
  Set(
    generated.User.Age.Incr(1),
    generated.User.Status.Set("active"),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

Association helpers are also generated to create, update, unlink, or delete linked records safely and intuitively, e.g.:

```go
// Create and associate a pet for a user
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

## Feature Highlights

- **SQL Template Directive Support:** Incorporate dynamic directives such as `@@table`, `@@column`, `@param`, and conditional blocks like `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` inside your SQL templates for flexible query definitions.

- **Configurable Generation Via genconfig.Config:** Customize output paths, field helper mappings, interface inclusion/exclusion, and more with package-level config literals.

- **Association Operations:** Support for comprehensive association workflows, ensuring correct foreign key manipulation and join table handling.

- **Type Safety and Discoverability:** All generated code emphasizes compile-time type checking and method autocomplete for a seamless developer experience.

---

## Real-World Applications

**Use Case 1: Rapid Development of Complex Queries**
Define interface methods with SQL annotations for intricate filters and update logic, then generate ready-to-use APIs that avoid runtime errors.

**Use Case 2: Safer Data Updates with Fluent API**
Leverage field helpers for atomic updates, bulk link/unlink association management, and zero-value support, removing manual SQL manipulation risks.

**Use Case 3: Batch Operations for Models and Relations**
Create or update multiple related records in batch with strong type assurance, simplifying large data migrations or multi-entity transactions.

---

## Practical Tips

- Regularly maintain your interface comments and SQL templates to keep generated APIs aligned with business logic.
- Utilize the `genconfig.Config` to tailor generation to your project structure and custom type mappings.
- Exploit association helpers to avoid common FK mismanagement.
- Combine generated field helpers with GORM's query capabilities for maximum power.
