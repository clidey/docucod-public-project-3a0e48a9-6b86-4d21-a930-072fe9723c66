# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe, Fluent Database Queries for Your Go Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful tool designed to transform your GORM development experience by generating type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model field helpers. It simplifies working with your database models by delivering compile-time safety and fluent APIs that streamline both read and write operations.

### Why GORM CLI Matters

- **Achieve Compile-Time Safety:** Eliminate common runtime errors related to SQL queries by generating strongly typed code directly from your Go interfaces and model definitions.
- **Fluent and Discoverable APIs:** Benefit from expressive, auto-completing query methods that make writing database queries clear and efficient.
- **Save Development Time:** Automate the generation of query code and model helpers, cutting down boilerplate and manual SQL crafting.

### Who Should Use This?

GORM CLI is ideal for Go developers who use GORM for database interaction and want to:

- Automate query code based on existing SQL-like interfaces
- Ensure query correctness at compile time
- Work seamlessly with model associations and updates
- Build maintainable and scalable data access layers

## What is GORM CLI?

At its core, GORM CLI is a code generator that takes your Go interfaces annotated with raw SQL templates and your Go model structs, then produces two complementary sets of code:

1. **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Implementations of your raw SQL interface methods, generated from method comments containing SQL templates.
2. **Model Field Helpers:** Strongly typed helpers derived from your model fields, designed to assist in filtering, updating, ordering, and managing associations.

This combination delivers a seamless way to write database queries that are checked at compile time for correctness and usage.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Without GORM CLI, writing database queries in Go with GORM often involves crafting raw SQL strings or working with GORM's API in a more manual, error-prone way. Bugs such as misspelled columns, incorrect SQL syntax, or mismatched types can quickly surface at runtime.

GORM CLI empowers you to define your queries as interfaces with annotated SQL templates in Go, then automatically generates strongly typed, ready-to-use APIs. This approach reduces errors, improves code readability, and accelerates development.

### Key Differentiators

- **Interface-Driven Generation:** You express your query intentions through Go interfaces with SQL templates embedded in method comments.
- **Compile-Time Validation:** Because your queries are strongly typed Go code, many mistakes are caught before you run your program.
- **Association Support:** Beyond simple field helpers, GORM CLI generates helpers for associations, making complex relational operations straightforward.
- **Customizable Config:** You can configure generation rules, customize field helper mappings, and selectively enable or exclude code generation via a dedicated configuration.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Type-Safe Query APIs

Define your query interface methods with SQL templates in method comments. GORM CLI will generate concrete implementations with the following characteristics:

- Auto-binding of method parameters to SQL placeholders.
- Inclusion of Go's `context.Context` automatically if not provided.
- Support for complex predicates, dynamic WHERE and SET clauses, and iteration over parameters.

**Example:**
```go
// SQL: SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```
The generated method runs a query safely bound to the `id` parameter.

### 2. Model Field Helpers

From your struct definitions, GORM CLI creates helpers for every field, typed by their Go type:

- **Predicate helpers:** `Eq`, `Like`, `Between`, `IsNull`, etc., that generate SQL predicates.
- **Update setters:** `Set`, `Incr`, `SetExpr` allow fluent update statements including zero values.
- **Association helpers:** Manage relations with `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, `Delete`, and batch operations.

**Example:**
```go
generated.User.Name.Like("%jinzhu%")  // Generates a WHERE clause fragment
```

### 3. Association Operations

Supports all major association types (`belongs to`, `has one`, `has many`, `many2many`) with type-safe methods to:

- Create and link related records.
- Update associated models conditionally.
- Unlink relations without deleting data.
- Delete associated records cleanly.
- Batch operations for multiple links at once.

### 4. Declarative SQL Template DSL

GORM CLI accepts SQL templates in Go comments with special directives:

| Directive | Purpose                      | Example                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `@@table` | Model's table name substitution | `SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id` |
| `@@column`| Dynamic column substitution   | `WHERE @@column=@value`             |
| `@param`  | Bind Go method parameters     | `WHERE name=@user.Name`             |
| `{{where}}`| Conditional WHERE block       | `{{where}} age > 18 {{end}}`       |
| `{{set}}` | Conditional SET block (for update) | `{{set}} name=@name {{end}}`     |
| `{{if}}`  | Conditionals inside templates | `{{if age > 0}} AND age=@age {{end}}` |
| `{{for}}` | Iteration over collections    | `{{for _, t := range tags}} ... {{end}}` |

This DSL enables crafting expressive, reusable, and safe query templates.

### 5. Configurable Code Generation

Customize generator behavior with a package-level `genconfig.Config` object:

- Override output paths
- Map Go types or struct tags to custom field helpers
- Whitelist or blacklist interfaces and structs for generation
- Specify file-level versus package-level control

### 6. Seamless Integration

Generated code complements the `gorm.io/gorm` ecosystem. You use it alongside the native GORM API for smooth interaction.

## Why Should You Care?

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Reduced runtime errors:** Catch query mismatches and type errors at compile time.
- **Readable, maintainable code:** Generated APIs are fluent and discoverable with autocomplete.
- **Faster development:** Focus on business logic instead of boilerplate SQL or query code.
- **Better association handling:** Manage complex data models with ease and safety.

### Real-World Use Cases

- Building data access layers with guaranteed type correctness
- Complex queries involving conditional filters and dynamic parameters
- Applications needing both CRUD and batch operations on relational data
- Projects where evolving schemas require fast, safe regeneration of query helpers

### Before & After

- **Before:** Handwriting SQL queries with error-prone string concatenations or manual GORM calls.
- **After:** Writing clear interfaces with annotated SQL templates and using generated, type-checked methods confidently.

### Return on Investment

- Minutes saved by automating query and model helper code generation
- Fewer bugs and debugging hours due to early error detection
- Scalable and consistent data layer implementations
