# Why Use GORM CLI?

## Unlocking Developer Productivity and Code Confidence

In modern Go applications using GORM, you're often caught between writing raw SQL queries and crafting complex ORM-based interactions. These challenges can introduce risks—runtime errors from invalid queries, tedious boilerplate code, and opaque database operations that slow down your development velocity.

GORM CLI transforms this experience by generating _type-safe_, _interface-driven_ query APIs paired with _model-driven_ field helpers. This dual approach empowers you to write cleaner, safer, and more maintainable database code with confidence.

## Core Benefits of GORM CLI

### 1. **Compile-Time Safety that Prevents Runtime Errors**

Raw SQL or string-based queries defer errors until runtime, risking unexpected failures. GORM CLI removes this uncertainty by generating methods from your Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates. These methods provide:

- Strongly typed arguments and results enforced by the Go compiler.
- Early detection of signature and query mismatches, saving debugging hours.
- Fluent, IDE-friendly APIs that surface autocompletion and inline documentation.

*Example:* Instead of hand-writing queries that may misuse parameters or columns, define an interface once and generate safe accessors:

```go
// Interface with SQL template
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)
```

This method compiles to a dependable API ensuring the right inputs and outputs.


### 2. **Dramatic Reduction of Boilerplate Code**

Manually writing query and update methods for CRUD operations is repetitive and error-prone. GORM CLI automatically generates:

- Query APIs customizable by your SQL hints.
- Model-based field helpers for predicates, setters, and association operations.

This automation lets you focus on core business logic rather than low-level SQL crafting.

*Scenario:* Filtering users by multiple dynamic conditions can be tedious:

```go
users, err := db.Where("name = ? AND age > ?", name, age).Find(&users)
```

With generated helpers, the code becomes expressive and concise:

```go
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Name.Eq(name), generated.User.Age.Gt(age)).Find(ctx)
```


### 3. **Accelerated API Development with Template-Based SQL Queries**

GORM CLI enables you to define SQL queries directly in Go interface method comments using a powerful templating DSL. This approach offers:

- Dynamic, expressive queries with conditional clauses and iterations.
- Seamless parameter binding tied to method signatures.
- Automatically generated implementations that adhere strictly to your defined intent.

*Example Template:* 

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table
// {{where}}
//   {{if @user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
//   {{if @user.Age > 0}} AND age=@user.Age {{end}}
// {{end}}
FilterUsers(user User) ([]User, error)
```

This declarative style enables rapid iteration without compromising correctness.


### 4. **Deep Integration With Your Existing GORM Workflows**

GORM CLI-generated APIs and helpers integrate naturally with `gorm.io/gorm`, allowing you to leverage familiar idioms:

- Use your generated query interfaces alongside existing GORM DB objects.
- Combine generated field predicates with GORM’s chaining and clause operations.
- Manage complex associations (has one/many, belongs to, many-to-many) with type-safe, concise helpers.

*Example:* Creating a user and associating pets can be done in a fluent, safe manner:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

## Addressing Common Developer Pain Points

| Challenge                              | How GORM CLI Helps                        |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Runtime SQL errors                    | Compile-time checked APIs prevent errors |
| Tedious boilerplate for queries      | Auto-generated APIs and field helpers    |
| Complex conditional queries           | Template DSL with conditionals and loops |
| Handling associations safely          | Strongly-typed association helpers       |
| Maintaining synchronization with DB   | Generated code reflects your models/interfaces|


## Real-World Scenario: Before and After GORM CLI

| Without GORM CLI                                      | With GORM CLI                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manually write SQL queries scattered across code.   | Define all queries cleanly in interfaces with embedded templates.|
| Verbose and repetitive query construction.           | Fluent, type-safe APIs auto-generated for queries and filters.  |
| Risk of runtime failure due to typos or misspellings| Compile-time validation catches issues early.                  |
| Manual handling of associations prone to bugs.       | Generated helpers simplify creation, update, unlink, delete.    |


## Summary of Value

- **Write safer, cleaner data access code.**
- **Reduce development time and maintenance overhead.**
- **Seamlessly extend and customize queries with powerful template SQL.**
- **Manage complex data relationships confidently with generated association helpers.**

## Getting Started

Begin your journey to safer and faster database operations by:

1. Defining Go interfaces with SQL templates for your common queries.
2. Writing your model structs as usual.
3. Running `gorm gen` to generate your type-safe query and field helper APIs.
4. Using the generated APIs to replace raw SQL or unstructured ORM calls.
