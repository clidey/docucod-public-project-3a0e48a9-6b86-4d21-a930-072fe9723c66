# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe, Interface-Driven Query APIs and Model-Driven Helpers for GORM

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed specifically for Go projects using GORM. Leveraging your Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates and your model structs, it generates two complementary code components:

- **Type-safe query APIs** that provide compile-time safety and fluent, discoverable methods for your database operations.
- **Model-driven field helpers** that simplify filtering, updating, ordering, and managing associations using strongly-typed, expressive fields.

Together, these generated components create an intuitive developer experience where you write less boilerplate and catch query errors early, enabling productive, reliable, and maintainable data access.

---

## What Does GORM CLI Enable You To Do?

At its core, GORM CLI transforms raw SQL annotations and Go struct definitions into robust type-safe APIs, letting you:

- **Define queries declaratively** in Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates — eliminating manual query building.
- **Use fluent, type-checked helpers** for filtering and updating fields, avoiding runtime errors caused by wrong columns or data types.
- **Perform complex association operations** (create, update, unlink, delete) safely with generated helpers matching your model relations.
- **Customize generation** through easy configuration, adapting the tool to your project’s coding standards and needs.

---

## Why GORM CLI Stands Out

- **Compile-time safety:** Catch errors early by generating APIs that reflect your database schema precisely.
- **Fluent, discoverable code:** Generated helpers promote clean, readable queries.
- **Generics-powered:** Modern Go generics (Go 1.18+) ensure the APIs are flexible and reusable.
- **Seamless GORM integration:** Generated APIs work naturally with GORM’s `gorm.io/gorm` package.
- **Dual-code generation:** Both query interfaces and model-driven helpers complement each other to cover reads and writes comprehensively.

---

## How GORM CLI Works at a High Level

1. **Define your models:** Regular Go structs capturing your schema with GORM annotations.
2. **Create query interfaces:** Interfaces written in Go, where method comments contain templated SQL queries.
3. **Run the generator:** The CLI parses your interfaces and structs, then produces:
   - Concrete, type-safe query implementations from interfaces.
   - Strongly typed field helpers for all model fields and associations.
4. **Use the generated code:** Call fluent methods to build and execute queries, updates, and association operations with safety and ease.

This approach eliminates handcrafting SQL or unsafe query strings, instead giving you a statically-checked, IDE-friendly API layer atop your database.

## Code Generation Workflow Example

```go
// Step 1: Define the Query Interface
// examples/query.go

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // WHERE name=@name AND age=@age
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}

// Step 2: Define Model
// examples/models/user.go

type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name string
  Age  int
}

// Step 3: Generate Code:
// Command line
$ gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

// Step 4: Use Generated API
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)
```

This minimal example highlights how interface methods with SQL templates become rich, type-safe functions for querying your database.

## Key Concepts You Should Know

- **SQL Template DSL:** Inside interface comments, you write SQL with `@@table`, `@@column` placeholders, `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` directives, and parameter binding syntax like `@param`.
- **Field Helpers:** Model structs generate field helpers such as `generated.User.Age.Eq(25)` or association operators like `generated.User.Pets.Create()`.
- **Association Operations:** Create, update, unlink, and delete related entities with generated fluent APIs tailored to each relationship type.

---

## Practical Benefits at a Glance

- **Boost developer productivity:** Cut down the boilerplate and error-prone code for SQL queries and complex data operations.
- **Improve code quality:** Strong typing and autocompletion help you write safer queries with confidence.
- **Simplify maintenance:** Changes in models automatically propagate to your query APIs through generation.
- **Support advanced real-world scenarios:** Handle polymorphic associations, batch operations, conditional dynamic queries, and more.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Queries">
<Accordion title="How do I install GORM CLI?">
Run:
```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```
Requires Go 1.18+ for generics support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are the prerequisites?">
You need Go modules enabled and GORM as a dependency. Define your models and queries in Go files with appropriate comments.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I customize which components to generate?">
Yes, you can use `genconfig.Config` with include/exclude patterns to control interfaces and structs your generator processes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do associations work with generated code?">
Associations are handled via generated helper fields. You can create, update, unlink, or delete associated records through these fluent setters on your models.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does it support polymorphic relations?">
Yes. Polymorphic associations in your GORM models generate the appropriate helpers for manipulation.
