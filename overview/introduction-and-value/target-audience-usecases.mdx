# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is meticulously crafted for Go developers, backend engineers, and teams who demand **type-safe, robust, and maintainable database access** layers. This page guides you to understand if GORM CLI fits your development needs and illustrates why it’s the right choice for certain user profiles and scenarios.

---

## Target Audience

### Go Developers Seeking Type Safety and Productivity
If you're a Go developer building backend systems, APIs, or microservices, GORM CLI offers you **compile-time guarantees** and **autogenerated type-safe query APIs**, empowering you to write safer, clearer, and more performant data access code.

### Backend Teams Building Enterprise and Scalable Platforms
Teams working on complex enterprise applications benefit from GORM CLI because it:

- Eliminates repetitive manual SQL and boilerplate
- Ensures consistent data layer abstractions
- Enables safer, maintainable interactions with your database schema

### Developers Requiring Strong Integration With GORM
If your project uses the GORM ORM library, GORM CLI seamlessly integrates, enhancing your usual workflow with:

- Code generation from your own Go interfaces and models
- Model-driven field helpers for filters, updates, and associations
- Fluent, discoverable APIs that increase iteration speed

### Projects Prioritizing Maintainability and Compile-Time Validation
When you want to avoid runtime SQL errors and minimize tedious debugging, GORM CLI's auto-generated, type-enforced APIs catch mistakes **before your code runs**, reducing bugs and improving code quality.

## Why GORM CLI Fits Your Workflow

### Comprehensive Coverage of Complex Use Cases
Whether your backend involves:

- Multi-layer enterprise architectures
- Rich entity relationships with associations
- Custom SQL querying needs

GORM CLI adapts to your requirements by generating **type-safe queries** and **association operations** with compile-time validation.

### Support for Advanced Use Cases
Examples of common scenarios where GORM CLI excels:

- Creating and updating entities along with their related associations in batch operations
- Filtering and querying complex model data with dynamic SQL templating
- Managing polymorphic and many-to-many relationships with ease

### Real-World Impact
Before GORM CLI, managing SQL and ORM code could mean:

- Writing error-prone SQL strings manually
- Struggling with implicit assumptions in query logic
- Lengthy debugging cycles due to runtime query errors

With GORM CLI:

- You generate clear, type-safe APIs directly from your code
- Benefit from fluent model-driven helpers reducing boilerplate
- Accelerate development and ensure correctness early in the process

---

## Concrete User Profiles

### Backend API Developers
Building REST or gRPC APIs that require precise, performant data access will find GORM CLI invaluable for **reducing boilerplate** and **guaranteeing consistent data retrieval and mutation** logic.

### Microservice Architects
Microservices often require lean, focused data access layers. GORM CLI generates compact, reusable query interfaces perfectly suited for microservice boundaries, ensuring **modularity** and **clean dependencies**.

### Teams Adopting Modern Go Patterns
If you follow idiomatic Go patterns with interfaces, generics, and dependency injection, GORM CLI respects and complements these with interface-driven query generation that fits naturally in your architecture.

---

## When Not to Use GORM CLI

While powerful, GORM CLI is focused on GORM-based Go projects. If your project:

- Does not use GORM as its ORM
- Does not benefit from generated query interfaces or model-driven helpers
- Uses a radically different approach to database access (e.g., raw SQL only without Go interfaces)

then this tool might not be a fit. Instead, consider lightweight SQL builders or raw queries suitable to your project style.
