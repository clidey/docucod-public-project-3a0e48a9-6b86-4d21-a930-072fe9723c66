# What is GORM CLI?

## Elevate Your GORM Project with Type-Safe, Fluent Database APIs

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed to transform your GORM projects by automatically generating **type-safe, interface-driven query APIs** and **model-driven field helpers**. It empowers you to elevate database access by combining compile-time safety with discoverable, fluent APIs for all your database reads and writes.

Whether you are building simple CRUD operations or complex queries, GORM CLI bridges the gap between raw SQL and Go’s type system, providing an intuitive development experience that minimizes runtime errors and enhances productivity.

---

## Introduction to GORM CLI

At its core, GORM CLI generates two essential and complementary sets of code:

- **Query APIs from Interfaces:** Define your queries declaratively using Go interfaces annotated with raw SQL template comments. The CLI generates concrete implementations that are fully type-safe and leverage Go generics.

- **Field Helpers from Models:** Based on your GORM model structs, GORM CLI generates strongly-typed helpers for fields and associations—enabling you to build filters, updates, ordering, and relation handling with compile-time guarantees.

This dual approach results in a seamlessly integrated workflow where your data layer becomes easier to write, read, and maintain.

## Why GORM CLI Matters to You

### Solve Real Developer Pain Points

- **Eliminate Runtime SQL Errors:** By generating type-safe query methods, GORM CLI ensures that your SQL statements and query parameters are matched against Go type information at compile time.

- **Fluent, Discoverable APIs:** Forget manual string concatenations or error-prone SQL builders. Generated methods and field helpers provide intuitive chaining and clear method signatures.

- **Comprehensive Coverage:** From simple filters and predicates to advanced association management (create, update, unlink, delete), everything is handled with type safety and configurable generation.

Example: Instead of writing raw SQL or reflection-heavy code to filter users, you can write:

```go
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)
```

## What Does GORM CLI Generate?

### 1. Interface-Driven Query APIs

You define Go interfaces representing your query methods, each method annotated with SQL templates. GORM CLI parses these annotations and generates concrete implementations that execute those queries safely.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers

For each model struct, GORM CLI generates a set of strongly-typed fields, predicates, and association handlers. These helpers allow you to express database operations on fields and relations naturally and safely.

For example, for a model like:

```go
  type User struct {
    ID    uint
    Name  string
    Age   int
  }
```

You get generated helpers like:

```go
  generated.User.ID.Eq(1)           // id = 1
  generated.User.Name.Like("%jinzhu%")  // name LIKE '%jinzhu%'
  generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65) // age BETWEEN 18 AND 65
```

## Key Benefits of Using GORM CLI

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Minimize bugs by catching SQL mismatches and type issues early.
- **Fluent and Readable Code:** Intuitive method chaining and natural Go syntax.
- **Effective Association Handling:** Create, update, unlink, and delete related records with generated helpers.
- **Customizable Generation:** Tailor field helper types, include/exclude specific interfaces or structs, and control output paths using simple configs.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works natively with GORM v1.18+ and Go generics.

## Real-World User Flow

Imagine you need to create a query method to fetch active users over 18. With GORM CLI:

<Steps>
<Step title="Write Query Interface">
Define an interface method with an SQL template comment.
</Step>
<Step title="Run GORM CLI Generator">
Use the `gorm gen` command specifying input interfaces and output path.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Generated Code">
Call the generated query or field helpers in your application with type safety:

```go
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge(ctx, "alice", 25)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

This flow reduces manual SQL writing, improves maintainability, and provides immediate type checking.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Start Small:** Begin by defining simple query interfaces and gradually add more methods.
- **Use Configs:** Optionally, add a `genconfig.Config` in your packages to customize which interfaces/structs to include or exclude.
- **Understand Template DSL:** Write powerful queries inside interface comments using `@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`, and other directives.
- **Leverage Associations:** Use generated relation helpers to manipulate related data safely and expressively.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin using GORM CLI:

1. Write your query interfaces with method comments that include SQL templates.
2. Define your GORM model structs.
3. Run `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated` to generate the code.
4. Import and start using the generated APIs in your application.

For step-by-step installation and detailed examples, refer to the [Installation & Getting Started](https://gorm.io/docs/cli_installation) section.
