# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlocking Type-Safe, Interface-Driven Query APIs for GORM

GORM CLI is a powerful code generator designed to transform your GORM projects by producing type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and model-driven field helpers. It integrates seamlessly with GORM and empowers developers with compile-time safety, eliminating common runtime errors while speeding up development through fluent, intuitive APIs.

---

### Why GORM CLI?
Imagine writing database queries without worrying about typos in column names or misused data types. With GORM CLI, this becomes a reality: you declare your query logic in Go interfaces using SQL templates, and the CLI generates fully type-safe, composable APIs. This approach reduces bugs, streamlines code navigation, and scales smoothly with your project.

---

## What Does GORM CLI Do?

- **Generates Type-Safe Query APIs from Interfaces:** Write Go interfaces with SQL templated comments that define your query methods. GORM CLI reads these interfaces and crafts concrete APIs, ensuring parameters and return types are consistent and safe.

- **Creates Model-Driven Field Helpers:** From your GORM model structs, GORM CLI produces strongly-typed field helpers. These helpers simplify building filters, updates, and association operations using fluent and discoverable syntax.

Together, these outputs deliver a robust, compile-time checked experience working with queries, filters, and related CRUD operations.

---

## The Core Value: Safety & Productivity Combined

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Avoid runtime surprises caused by incorrect field names or type mismatches with generated code that enforces correctness during build.

- **Fluent, Discoverable APIs:** Interact with strongly-typed query interfaces and field helpers that are easy to explore and compose, enhancing developer experience.

- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Automatically generate increasingly complex query and association code that would otherwise require tedious manual implementation.

- **Easy Integration with GORM:** GORM CLI extensions integrate naturally into the GORM tooling workflow, ensuring seamless adoption without heavy refactoring.

---

## How It Fits In Your Workflow

1. **Define Your Query Interfaces:** Write Go interfaces with method comments containing SQL templates (including placeholders and control directives).

2. **Generate Code:** Use the `gorm gen` CLI command to produce your tailored query APIs and field helpers.

3. **Use Generated APIs:** Call the fluent, type-safe methods in your application code against your GORM database connection.

### Example Snapshot

```go
// Define type-safe query interface
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}

// Generated usage
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

This flow guarantees you write fewer runtime-interpreted queries and more statically vetted operations.

## Technical Highlights (What Happens Under the Hood)

- **Code generation driven by Go's AST:** Parses your Go source files, extracts interfaces and structs, and interprets SQL templates.

- **Template DSL for SQL:** Supports directives like `@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`, and `{{set}}` that enable dynamic, reusable, and conditional query construction.

- **Out-of-the-Box Customization:** You can control generated code via package-level configurations for output directory, inclusion/exclusion filters, and custom field type mappings.

- **Built on Robust Tooling:** Uses reliable Go libraries like `cobra` for CLI commands and Go `imports` for formatting generated code.

---

## Real-World Benefits

- **Reduce Production Bugs:** Catch mistakes during development, not production.

- **Accelerate Development:** Autocomplete-friendly APIs reduce cognitive load.

- **Flexible Query Composition:** Customize and extend queries safely at compile time.

- **Consistent Codebase:** Uniform query and filter constructions improve maintainability.
