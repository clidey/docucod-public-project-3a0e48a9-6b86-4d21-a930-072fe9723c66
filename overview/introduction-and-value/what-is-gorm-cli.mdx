# What is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a powerful command-line tool designed to generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven helpers specifically for GORM-based Go applications. By transforming your Go interfaces and model struct definitions into fluent, strongly-typed APIs, it streamlines database interactions, enhancing code safety and developer productivity.

---

## Why GORM CLI Matters

Interacting with databases in Go often involves writing raw SQL or relying on generic ORM methods that lack compile-time safety, increasing the risk of runtime errors and reducing code clarity. GORM CLI changes this by generating:

- **Interface-driven, type-safe query APIs:** Define your queries using Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates; the tool generates concrete implementation with compile-time guarantees.
- **Model-driven field helpers:** From your model structs, it generates strongly typed helpers to build filters, updates, and manage associations.

Together, these components provide a fluent, discoverable API that helps you write robust database code with confidence.

## What is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a command-line code generator that analyzes your Go code to produce two complementary assets:

- **Type-safe Query APIs:** Developers write Go interfaces with SQL comments to declare queries. GORM CLI generates API implementations based on these interfaces that ensure type safety and automatically bind parameters.

- **Field Helpers Based on Models:** It generates helpers for your GORM models, enabling concise, type-safe expressions for conditions, updates, and association operations.

This approach enables developers to avoid unsafe string concatenations, get compile-time error detection, and benefit from IDE autocompletion.

---

## Key Components & Benefits

### Interface-Driven Query APIs
Write Go interfaces where each method's comment includes SQL templates. For example:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

GORM CLI parses these and generates methods that safely bind parameters and return typed results, drastically reducing boilerplate and runtime mistakes.

### Model-Driven Field Helpers
Generate helpers based on your model struct fields representing their types and database columns. For example:

```go
generated.User.Name.Like("%jinzhu%")
```

Such expressions can be composed in queries and updates, producing readable and safe code.

### Association Helpers
Manage related entities via generated API:

- Create and link associated records
- Update related rows safely
- Unlink relationships without deleting data
- Batch creation and linking

This ensures consistent handling of complex model relationships with ease.

## What Problems Does GORM CLI Solve?

- **Eliminates unsafe SQL strings:** By providing compile-time checked query functions.
- **Simplifies crafting complex queries:** Through reusable SQL templates and generated fluent interfaces.
- **Automatically manages model associations:** With type-safe helpers, reducing error-prone manual handling.
- **Enhances maintainability:** Changes in models or queries propagate safely to generated code.

## How GORM CLI Fits Into Your Workflow

1. **Define your Go models and query interfaces:** Use comments in interfaces to describe SQL queries with placeholders.
2. **Run the GORM CLI generator:** Converts your definitions into concrete, type-safe Go code.
3. **Use the generated APIs in your application:** Gain compile-time validation and IDE assistance.

Example quick usage:

```go
// Query interface
 type Query[T any] interface {
     // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
     GetByID(id int) (T, error)
 }

// Model
 type User struct {
     gorm.Model
     Name string
     Age  int
 }

// Generate code
// gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

// Use generated API
 u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

## Summary

GORM CLI complements GORM by providing a layer of generated, type-safe query code and helper functions that simplify and enforce correctness in your database codebase. It's designed for those aiming to build scalable and maintainable Go applications with strong typing and minimal manual SQL handling.
