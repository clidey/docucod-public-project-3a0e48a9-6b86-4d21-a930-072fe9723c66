# Why Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is your indispensable tool to eliminate the tedious and error-prone boilerplate code that typically plagues database interactions in Go applications using GORM. By automatically generating robust, type-safe database interfaces, filters, updates, and association helpers, it empowers you to write cleaner, safer, and more maintainable code.

---

## Unlock Productivity Through Automation

Instead of manually crafting repetitive code for database queries and operations, GORM CLI lets you generate this essential glue code automatically from your models and query interfaces. This means you free up your time to focus on business logic, while the CLI handles consistent, bug-resistant data access layers.

### Key Advantages
- **Compile-Time Safety:** Static type checking prevents runtime errors caused by invalid fields or parameter types, giving you confidence in your data interactions.
- **Clear, Discoverable APIs:** Generated methods and field helpers provide intuitive, IDE-friendly code completion for queries, filters, updates, and associations.
- **Faster Iterations:** Modify your model or interface definitions and regenerate instantly, keeping your data layer in sync without manual edits.

---

## What You Gain with GORM CLI

### 1. Auto-Generated Query Interfaces
Write simple Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates in comments, and GORM CLI generates concrete, type-safe implementations. This removes the risk of SQL injection and mismatched parameters.

```go
// Define your interface with SQL template comments
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

You get ready-to-use methods like `GetByID` generated for your models, enabling:
- Seamless parameter binding
- Compile-time validation of query signatures
- Automatic context injection for cancellation and deadlines

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers
From your existing Go structs defining database models, GORM CLI produces strongly typed field helpers for each database column, supporting filtering, ordering, and updates.

```go
// Example generated field helpers for User model
User.Name.Eq("Alice")          // WHERE name = 'Alice'
User.Age.Between(18, 30)        // WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 30
User.Score.IsNull()              // WHERE score IS NULL
```

These helpers streamline constructing WHERE clauses, SET expressions, and more — all type-safe and expressive.

### 3. Association Management with Confidence
Handling GORM associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many2many, polymorphic) correctly is challenging. The CLI generates precise helpers to:
- Create and link child or related entities
- Update associated records conditionally
- Unlink associations safely (setting foreign keys to NULL or removing join records)
- Delete associated rows cleanly

Example:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(
    User.Pets.Create(Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

This ensures referential integrity and consistent association semantics with minimal effort.

### 4. Concise and Flexible SQL Templating DSL
GORM CLI understands a powerful SQL template DSL embedded in interface method comments, enabling dynamic queries with:
- Table (`@@table`) and column (`@@column`) placeholders
- Parameter bindings (`@param`) with sanitization
- Conditional WHERE and SET clauses (`{{where}}`, `{{set}}`)
- Control flow: `{{if}}`, `{{else if}}`, `{{else}}`, `{{for}}` iterations

Example:

```sql
-- SELECT with conditional WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM @@table
{{where}}
    {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
    {{if user.Age > 0}} AND age=@user.Age {{end}}
{{end}}
```

This template translates into safe, efficient Go code for flexible database querying.

## Real-World Scenario: Improved Developer Workflow

**Before GORM CLI:** You spend hours writing repetitive query methods using raw SQL strings or crafting interface wrappers prone to runtime errors. Association updates require careful manual coding to avoid FK mistakes.

**After GORM CLI:**
- Write interfaces with clear SQL templates just once.
- Generate comprehensive, type-safe APIs with a single command.
- Effortlessly manage associations with generated helpers.
- Refactor and extend your data layer faster and safer.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Model Your Domain Clearly:** Well-defined GORM models yield precise field helpers and association operations.
- **Write Expressive Query Interfaces:** Use the rich template syntax to encapsulate common queries.
- **Leverage Configurations:** Utilize `genconfig.Config` to control output paths, include/exclude filters, and customize field mappings.
- **Iterate Often:** Regenerate code as your models and queries evolve to keep generated APIs current.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Using GORM CLI">
<Accordion title="My generated code doesn’t compile due to missing imports or type errors">
Ensure your `genconfig.Config` includes correct mappings for custom or embedded types. Review import paths and regenerate. Custom field mappings (e.g., JSON fields) help the generator resolve types properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Queries don’t bind parameters correctly or produce runtime SQL errors">
Check your SQL template syntax, especially placeholders like `@@table`, `@param`, and use conditional blocks properly. Refer to the DSL examples for correct template structure.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Associations behave unexpectedly (e.g., foreign keys not cleared on unlink)">
User misconfiguration or mismatch between GORM models and generated helpers is often the cause. Confirm your model relationships follow GORM conventions, and regenerate to match.
