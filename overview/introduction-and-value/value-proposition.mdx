# Key Benefits & Use Cases

Unlock the full power of GORM CLI by understanding its principal benefits and ideal use cases. This page emphasizes why adopting GORM CLI transforms your Go data access layer into a type-safe, fluent, and efficient experience — especially when working with GORM.

---

## Why Choose GORM CLI? Your Benefits at a Glance

GORM CLI stands apart by combining code generation focused on two core outputs — type-safe query interfaces and model-driven field helpers — enabling developers to build robust query APIs and handle model fields with precision.

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Automatically generated, type-safe APIs eliminate whole classes of runtime errors, so bugs related to invalid field names or mismatched query parameters simply cannot compile.
- **Fluent, Discoverable APIs:** Generated field helpers provide an intuitive, expressive syntax for building queries and updates, improving developer productivity and code clarity.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Leverage GORM CLI without leaving the comfort of GORM’s idiomatic patterns. The generated code works naturally with `gorm.io/gorm`.
- **Powerful Template-Driven Queries:** Define your SQL queries in Go interface comments with dynamic template DSL support, enabling safe, maintainable, and flexible querying.
- **Strong Support for Associations:** Automatically generated helpers cover all common GORM association types (has one, has many, belongs to, many2many), with operations like create, update, unlink, and delete done safely and expressively.

---

## What Problems Does GORM CLI Solve?

Developers working with GORM often face:

- Risk of runtime errors caused by dynamically written SQL or string-based query building without type safety.
- Tedious, repetitive code when handling common filtering, updates, and association manipulations.
- Difficulty managing complex queries that evolve dynamically based on user input or application state.

GORM CLI addresses these pain points by generating ready-to-use, type-safe APIs and helpers to ensure your queries and model operations are correct by design.

---

## Typical Teams and Projects That Gain the Most

GORM CLI is perfect for:

- **Teams prioritizing maintainability and correctness:** Strong typing catches mistakes early, reducing debugging and QA overhead.
- **Large codebases with complex domain models:** Auto-generated field helpers simplify working with nested structs and associations.
- **Projects needing flexible, reusable query templates:** Use interface methods with SQL templates and DSL directives to craft reusable, composable queries.
- **Developers embracing idiomatic Go with GORM:** The CLI-generated code fits naturally into existing GORM workflows without disrupting established practices.

---

## Core Use Cases Explored

### 1. Type-Safe Query APIs from Go Interfaces

Write an interface describing your query methods with embedded SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI generates methods that:

- Support compile-time validation of parameter types
- Automatically inject SQL placeholders and mapping
- Return strongly typed results (e.g., single entity or slice of entities)

**Example:**

```go
// UserQuery defines queries for User with template comments.
type UserQuery[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // Filter by dynamic column and value
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE @@column=@value
  FilterWithColumn(column string, value string) (T, error)
}
```

Generated code enforces that `id` is an `int` and returns the correct type `T` with no runtime guessing.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers for Filters and Updates

From your struct models, GORM CLI generates field helpers for every database column and association:

- **Basic fields (ints, strings, time, booleans, etc):** helpers like `.Eq()`, `.Like()`, `.Between()` let you fluently build predicates.
- **Associations:** Helpers support operations like `.Create()`, `.Update()`, `.Unlink()`, `.Delete()`, and batch creation for related entities.
- **Support for nullable and custom types:** GORM CLI detects if a type implements `Scanner` or `Valuer` and correctly maps it.

**Example:**

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice"), generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Set(generated.User.IsAdult.Set(true)).
  Update(ctx)
```

---

### 3. Seamless Operations with Associations

Manipulate related records safely and expressively:

- Create linked child records at the time of parent insertion
- Update related records matching filters
- Unlink associations to nullify foreign keys or remove join table entries
- Delete related records fully

**Example:** Creating a user with pets:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("bob"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("rex")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

---

### 4. Dynamic and Conditional Queries via Template DSL

GORM CLI’s DSL expands your ability to write flexible SQL queries directly in your Go interfaces using directives such as:

- `@@table` and `@@column` for model-aware substitution
- `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` blocks for dynamic clauses
- Conditional (`{{if}}`/`{{else}}`) and iterative (`{{for}}`) SQL generation

**Example:**

```go
// Search users with optional filters
// SELECT * FROM @@table
// {{where}}
//   {{if name != ""}} name=@name {{end}}
//   {{if age > 0}} AND age=@age {{end}}
// {{end}}
SearchUsers(name string, age int) ([]User, error)
```

## Before and After GORM CLI

| Without GORM CLI                            | With GORM CLI                         |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Manual string concatenation, error-prone  | Compile-time safety with code gen    |
| Repetitive boilerplate for filtering       | Fluent, auto-generated field helpers|
| Association manipulation is tedious        | Expressive, safe association helpers |
| Difficult to maintain dynamic queries      | Template-driven, maintainable DSL    |


## Return on Investment (ROI)

- **Time Savings:** Drastically reduce manual coding of query logic and field helpers.
- **Fewer Bugs:** Static typing and code generation catch mistakes early.
- **Cleaner Code:** Generated APIs encourage idiomatic, readable Go code.
- **Easier Refactors:** Changes in model struct fields automatically propagate to helpers and queries.

## Getting Started Preview

Experience these benefits by first writing your query interfaces and model structs, then running the CLI to generate the code.

After code generation, seamlessly use the new type-safe query APIs and field helpers to build your application logic.

## Tips for Success

- Define clear, concise interfaces with meaningful query methods and comments.
- Leverage the DSL for dynamic filtering and updating instead of writing complex manual queries.
- Use association helpers for complex model relations to simplify code and ensure correctness.
- Utilize `genconfig.Config` for custom mapping and fine-tuning generation behavior.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Generated code not compiling:** Ensure your interfaces have correct method signatures and return types with error as the last parameter.
- **Field helpers missing for custom types:** Confirm those types implement `database/sql.Scanner` or GORM’s `SerializerInterface`, or map them via `genconfig.Config`.
- **Association operations not working as expected:** Verify association tags in your model structs and that you use the correct association helper methods.
