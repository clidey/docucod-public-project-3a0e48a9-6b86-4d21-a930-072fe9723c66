# Target Audience & Use Cases

Discover who benefits most from GORM CLI and explore real-world scenarios where it transforms Go-based data access. This page helps you identify whether GORM CLI fits your development needs and how it seamlessly integrates into modern project workflows.

---

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed with a focus on Go developers and teams who want safer, more maintainable, and efficient data access layers in their applications. These are the primary audiences:

- **Go Developers Using GORM:** If your project already uses GORM for ORM functionalities, GORM CLI enhances your experience by generating compile-time safe, type-driven query APIs and field helpers.
- **Teams Prioritizing Code Safety:** Teams aiming to reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability benefit from the strong type safety and fluent API design that GORM CLI enables.
- **Developers Needing Streamlined Query & Field Management:** Those who want to avoid manual query building and boilerplate can use the CLI generator to produce intuitive, discoverable methods.
- **Projects Favoring Template-Based Query Flexibility:** Developers who prefer writing SQL templates in interfaces and automating the boilerplate generation will find GORM CLI’s SQL Template DSL especially valuable.

---

## Core Benefits Tailored to Users

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Eliminate many classes of bugs by generating APIs that check types and SQL query parameters at compile time.
- **Fluent, Discoverable API:** Auto-generated field helpers and query interfaces lead to clearer, more concise code with intelligent method chaining.
- **Simplified Association Handling:** Seamlessly operate on related data using generated association helpers, supporting create, update, unlink, and delete operations safely.
- **Customizable Generation Behavior:** Teams can tailor generation through `genconfig.Config` for field mapping, file filtering, and output paths to fit project structure.

## Real-World Use Cases

Here are specific scenarios illustrating where GORM CLI excels in a typical Go project lifecycle:

### 1. Safety Net for Critical Data Access
A fintech application requires highly reliable database interactions to minimize runtime errors. By using GORM CLI, the team generates type-safe query interfaces ensuring that parameter mismatches or missing fields are caught early during development.

### 2. Rapid API Development for CRUD Services
An internal tool needs quick iteration of CRUD operations with filtering, sorting, and associations. GORM CLI allows writing simple SQL templates and model definitions, quickly generating the code to power flexible APIs without writing repetitive query logic.

### 3. Managing Complex Associations Confidently
A social media platform deals with user profiles, posts, comments, and relationships. Using association helpers generated by GORM CLI, developers can create, update, unlink, or delete associated data in batch operations, enforcing consistency and clarity.

### 4. Streamlining Query Evolution in Large Teams
In a large engineering team, defining queries manually can lead to inconsistent patterns and bugs. GORM CLI’s interface-driven queries standardize query code, improving maintainability and easing onboarding.

## Before and After GORM CLI Adoption

| Before GORM CLI                         | After GORM CLI                                      |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Manually build SQL queries and scan   | Write declarative Go interfaces with SQL templates |
| error-prone query parameter binding   | Generate type-safe APIs with compile-time checks  |
| Handcraft field management and updates| Use generated field helpers for concise updates   |
| Complex manual association operations | Safely handle associations via generated helpers  |

---

## Typical User Workflow Integration

1. **Define Your Models and Query Interfaces**
   - Write Go structs for your models.
   - Define interfaces with SQL templates describing your queries clearly.

2. **Run GORM CLI Code Generation**
   - Use `gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated` to auto-generate query APIs and field helpers.

3. **Develop Using Generated APIs**
   - Replace manual SQL and query handling with fluent, type-safe methods.
   - Confidently perform CRUD and complex association operations.

4. **Maintain and Extend Easily**
   - Update models or queries by editing the interface or model definitions.
   - Regenerate the code without touching underlying query logic.

---

## Practical Tips for Success

- **Start Small:** Begin by defining simple query interfaces and generating basic CRUD code.
- **Leverage Associations:** Model your relationships explicitly to unlock powerful association helpers.
- **Use Configuration for Complexity:** Customize generation behavior when working with complex or legacy schemas.
- **Read Generated Code:** To deepen understanding, reviewing generated methods reveals how SQL templates become executable queries.
