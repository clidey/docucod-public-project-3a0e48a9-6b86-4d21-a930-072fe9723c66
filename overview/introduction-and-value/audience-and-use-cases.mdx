# Target Audience & Use Cases

Welcome to the pivotal guide on who benefits most from **GORM CLI** and how it fits into varied development workflows. Whether you're part of a startup speeding through rapid prototyping or embedded in an enterprise team managing expansive codebases, this page helps you understand exactly how GORM CLI aligns with your goals.

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is tailor-made for developers and engineering teams building **data-driven Go applications** that leverage the popular GORM ORM. It empowers you to write safer, cleaner, and more maintainable database queries backed by compile-time checks.

### Ideal Users Include:

- **Go developers** creating backend applications requiring complex SQL queries with type safety.
- **Teams adopting GORM** that want to reduce boilerplate and automate tedious query and field helper generation.
- **Organizations aiming for scalable codebases** where query correctness and maintainability are critical.
- **Developers looking for safer querying patterns**, minimizing runtime errors through interface-driven APIs.
- **Projects needing customizable code generation workflows** that adapt to various conventions and structures.

## Why GORM CLI Matters to You

Building Go applications with GORM often involves repetitive, error-prone query construction and manual maintenance of query layers. GORM CLI eliminates these pain points by:

- **Automatically generating type-safe query APIs** from your defined interfaces with embedded SQL templates.
- Providing **model-driven field helpers** that simplify writing filters, updates, and association operations with expressive, fluent API calls.
- Allowing **flexible configuration and filtering** so only relevant models and interfaces are targeted in code generation.
- Enabling **best-of-both-worlds: compile-time safety and developer productivity.**

## Common Usage Scenarios

Explore how GORM CLI fits naturally into various project phases and complexity layers.

### 1. Rapid Prototyping

When spinning up a new service or feature, speed is key. Define minimal SQL interface methods with clear templates, generate APIs instantly, and start querying with confidence. GORM CLI accelerates early development by reducing boilerplate while guarding against common mistakes.

**Example:**

```go
// Simple query interface
interface UserQuery[T any] {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}

// Generate code and immediately use type-safe calls
user, err := generated.UserQuery[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

### 2. Medium-Scale Applications

For growing services integrating more complex models and associations, GORM CLI's field helpers and association management shine. You gain fluent APIs for multi-level filters, batch creates, updates, and safe association handling.

**Benefit:** Automatically generate helpers like `generated.User.Pets.Create(...)` or filtering helpers that catch typing errors before runtime.

### 3. Large Enterprises & Complex Systems

When your codebase involves hundreds of models and many teams, manual query management becomes a liability. GORM CLI's configurable generation allows selective targeting via include/exclude rules and file-level config overrides. Teams can establish uniform query patterns backed by tested templates.

**Outcome:** Consistent, maintainable query layers with automated updates tied to model changes, reducing maintenance overhead and onboarding time.

## How GORM CLI Fits into Your Workflow

GORM CLI acts as the bridge between your domain model definitions and the type-safe database interactions you write daily.

1. **Define your data models** with GORM in Go.
2. **Write interfaces with embedded SQL templates** describing queries and mutations.
3. **Configure generation options** for your project structure and selective code targeting.
4. **Run `gorm gen`** to produce strongly typed query APIs and field helpers.
5. **Integrate generated code** into your application — enjoy compile-time guarantees and developer-friendly APIs.

This flow drastically reduces manual query coding and minimizes bugs.

## Practical Examples of Use Cases

Here are clear, relatable situations showing how GORM CLI adds value:

### Filtering & Querying
Instead of building raw SQL strings or repetitive GORM query chains, use generated query interfaces:

```go
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterWithColumn(ctx, "role", "admin")
```

### Sophisticated Model Updates
Automatic generation of conditional SET clauses lets you express updates elegantly:

```go
err := generated.Query[User](db).UpdateInfo(ctx, User{Name: "alice", Age: 30}, userID)
```

This ensures only relevant fields are updated with proper SQL.

### Association Management
Manage related data safely with generated helpers, e.g., create pets linked to a user:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).Set(
  generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
  generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
).Create(ctx)
```

### Custom Workflows
With package-level configuration, teams can fine-tune which interfaces or structs participate in generation, supporting diverse project needs.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

- Start small with key query interfaces and expand as your app evolves.
- Use `genconfig.Config` to control code generation scope precisely, avoiding unnecessary code.
- Leverage field type mappings to integrate custom SQL expressions or JSON fields seamlessly.
- Combine generated APIs with `gorm.io/gorm` idiomatic usage for best ergonomics.
- Regularly regenerate when models or query interfaces change to keep alignment.

## Summary

GORM CLI is essential for Go teams using GORM who want to take advantage of automated, type-safe query and helper generation. Its flexible design supports quick prototypes and large, complex systems alike, empowering you to build reliable data access layers faster and safer.
