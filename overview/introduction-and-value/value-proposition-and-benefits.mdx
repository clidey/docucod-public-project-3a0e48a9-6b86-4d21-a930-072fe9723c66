# Product Value & Key Benefits

Discover how GORM CLI empowers you to write database queries and data manipulation logic with unmatched safety, expressiveness, and developer efficiency. This page explains why GORM CLI’s generated code stands apart by eliminating repetitive boilerplate, enforcing strong typing, and enabling a consistent, intuitive API for working with GORM.

## Why GORM CLI Matters: Elevating Developer Productivity and Code Safety

Imagine transforming often tedious, error-prone query writing into a smooth, type-safe experience where your IDE guides you through every step. GORM CLI bridges the gap between raw SQL and Go code, enabling you to:

- **Avoid tedious, repetitive SQL boilerplate** by generating query methods automatically from simple interface definitions.
- **Catch mistakes at compile time** through strong typing, preventing costly runtime errors due to type mismatches or misspelled columns.
- **Write expressive, maintainable, and discoverable query APIs** that align closely with your data model and business logic.

By harnessing your existing model structs and interface definitions annotated with SQL templates, GORM CLI outputs fluent Go code for querying, filtering, updating, and associating data — all with the robustness of compile-time checks.

---

## Key Value Propositions

- **Automatic Query API Generation:** Simply define interfaces with SQL templates, and GORM CLI generates type-safe Go methods that seamlessly plug into your GORM workflow.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Generate field helper types for your models enabling strongly typed predicates, set operations, and association management with fluent syntax and safety guarantees.
- **Template-Based Flexible Queries:** Use a powerful DSL to express dynamic SQL queries with conditional clauses, iteration, and parameter binding, then rely on GORM CLI to produce safe, optimized Go code.
- **Seamless Integration:** Output fits naturally into your GORM projects, requiring no additional runtime dependencies or manual code maintenance.
- **Advanced Association Operations:** Easily create, update, unlink, or delete related entities through generated helpers with compile-time validation.

## How GORM CLI Delivers These Benefits

### Eliminates Boilerplate While Guaranteeing Type Safety

Instead of hand-writing SQL strings over and over, define clear interfaces like this:

```go
// Query interface with SQL templates
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)

// Dynamic column filtering
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE @@column=@value
FilterWithColumn(column string, value string) (T, error)
```

GORM CLI generates implementations that:
- Bind parameters safely, escaping and typing them properly.
- Return strongly typed results matching your models.

This means your IDE can autocomplete fields and method parameters, and errors surface before you ever run your program.

### Empowers Expressive, Dynamic Queries With Embedded DSL

Use directives like `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}}`, and `{{for}}` inside your interface comments to construct flexible queries that adapt to your runtime conditions, for example:

```sql
-- Dynamic update with conditional SET clause
UPDATE @@table
{{set}}
  {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name, {{end}}
  {{if user.Age > 0}} age=@user.Age, {{end}}
  {{if user.Age >= 18}} is_adult=1 {{else}} is_adult=0 {{end}}
{{end}}
WHERE id=@id
```

The generator turns these templates into Go code that handles conditionals and parameter lists safely, eliminating common mistakes such as forgotten commas or incorrect SQL syntax.

### Model-Driven Field Helpers for Fluent and Safe Data Manipulation

From your existing model structs (e.g., `User`, `Pet`), GORM CLI generates:
- **Field helpers:** for predicate and setter methods (`Eq`, `Like`, `Between`, `Set`, `Incr`)
- **Association helpers:** for relationships allowing create, update, unlink, delete, and batch operations

Example API usage for a generated `User` model helper:

```go
// Find users older than 18
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)

// Create new user and associate pets
err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This provides discoverable, composable methods that make complex operations clear and concise without losing safety.

### Minimizes Human Error and Maximizes Developer Confidence

- **Strong typing at compile-time** avoids common bugs like misspelled field names or incompatible types.
- **Auto-injection of contextual parameters** such as `context.Context` ensures consistent, idiomatic API usage.
- Conditions and loops inside SQL templates become Go control flow with verified safety.

## Real-World Context: How This Makes Your Development Better

| With GORM CLI                                                | Without GORM CLI                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Create and maintain complex query code with minimal effort  | Hand-write and debug complex SQL strings repeatedly   |
| Get IDE autocomplete and compile-time safety for queries     | Risk runtime SQL errors due to typos or bad parameters|
| Use field and association helpers for complex cascades      | Manually write error-prone nested CRUD logic          |
| Leverage conditional, flexible templated queries with ease  | Duplicate similar queries with minor differences      |

By shifting query generation from manual to automated and type-safe, teams reduce bugs, accelerate development, and improve maintainability.

## Best Practices and Tips to Maximize Benefits

- **Define clear query interfaces early:** Draft your core query patterns as interfaces with annotated templates to leverage type safety from the start.
- **Leverage the template DSL for dynamic queries:** Use `{{where}}`, `{{if}}`, and `{{for}}` to create adaptable, clear SQL embedded in Go code.
- **Use model-driven field and association helpers:** Avoid raw SQL for CRUD let the generated helpers manage relationships consistently.
- **Customize generation via `genconfig.Config` if needed:** Fine-tune output paths, mappings, and inclusions for your project’s structure.
