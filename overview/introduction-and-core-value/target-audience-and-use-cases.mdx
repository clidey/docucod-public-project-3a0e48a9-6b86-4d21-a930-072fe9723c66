# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits Most from GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed for Go developers and teams building applications with GORM who need robust, maintainable, and type-safe database access layers. It particularly serves:

- **Backend developers** aiming to write concise, type-safe query methods without repetitive SQL boilerplate.
- **Full-stack teams** who want to rapidly prototype database queries with compile-time validation.
- **Enterprise teams** managing complex domain models with rich associations who require fluent, strongly-typed APIs to ensure code correctness.
- **Projects with evolving database schemas** where generated code keeps queries in sync automatically.

## Practical Scenarios Where GORM CLI Excels

### Rapid Prototyping and Development
Developers can write Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates and immediately generate type-safe query APIs. This accelerates experimenting with database queries and reduces manual SQL coding errors.

Example scenario:
```go
// Define query interface with SQL template
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```
After generation, calling `GetByID` retrieves data safely with no runtime query errors caused by mismatched parameters.

### Enforcing Query Safety & Compile-Time Validation
Because queries are generated from Go interfaces and models, the compiler checks method signatures and usage. This eliminates common runtime errors due to SQL syntax mistakes or incorrect parameter binding.

### Simplifying Complex Associations
GORM CLI generates field helper APIs for all major association types (has one, has many, belongs to, many-to-many).

Users can fluently create, update, unlink, or delete related entities with type-safe methods, preventing typical bugs in managing relational data.

Example:
```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```
This declarative pattern handles association CRUD with clear semantics.

### Automating Repetitive Database Code
Manually writing data access layers is time-consuming and error-prone. GORM CLI shifts the burden to code generation by:

- Automatically producing query implementations from annotated interfaces.
- Creating field helpers from model structs, reflecting customizations and DB schema.
- Supporting configuration overlays for inclusion/exclusion rules and custom mappings.

This results in higher productivity and fewer bugs.

### Suitable Project Types and Integration Strategies

GORM CLI is ideal for:

- **Medium to large GORM projects** with many entities and complex query requirements.
- **Microservices** needing standardized, type-safe query APIs to communicate with their databases.
- **Legacy codebases** in Go that want to adopt safer query patterns without rewriting everything manually.

It integrates seamlessly into existing Go projects with GORM by:

- Adding `gorm gen` commands to developer workflows.
- Using configuration files (`genconfig.Config`) for incremental adoption and customization.
- Generating code in specified output directories to stay modular.

## Summary of Key Benefits

| Benefit                     | What It Means for You                             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Type Safety**             | Catch query errors at compile time               |
| **Fluent APIs**             | Build complex queries and updates easily         |
| **Reduced Boilerplate**     | Write less manual SQL and glue code              |
| **Customizable Generation** | Match your project’s needs and conventions       |
| **Strong Association Support** | Manage related data consistently and safely   |

## Best Practices and Tips

- Define clear query interfaces with meaningful method names and SQL annotations.
- Annotate your model structs for customized field helper types (e.g., JSON fields).
- Use config files to progressively include/exclude interfaces and structs during generation.
- Combine generated APIs with GORM’s powerful features like expression builders and transactions.
- Write tests for your generated queries as demonstrated in the `examples/output/query_test.go` file.

<Note>
For detailed examples of using type-safe queries and managing associations, see the guides under the **Core Workflows** tab in the documentation.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- Ensure your query interface methods follow the required signatures (return values with error as last parameter).
- Keep SQL templates accurate and test generated code to validate expected behavior.
- Use the `--input` and `--output` flags carefully when running `gorm gen` to avoid overwriting or missing files.

## Next Steps

- Explore `Quickstart Overview` and `Generate Code: Your First Run` docs to get hands-on with GORM CLI.
- Review examples in the `examples` directory of the repository to see practical use cases.
- Customize generation behaviors via `genconfig.Config` for your project needs.
