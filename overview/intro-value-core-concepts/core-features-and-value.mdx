# Core Features and Value Proposition

Unlock the full potential of your GORM projects with GORM CLI's powerhouse features designed to streamline your data interactions with safety, speed, and elegance.

## Elevate Your Development with Type-Safe, Fluent Query APIs

GORM CLI uniquely transforms your Go interfaces and model structs into robust, type-safe query APIs and helpers — empowering you to write database queries that are not only expressive but validated at compile time.

### Why This Matters to You

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Prevent runtime errors by catching invalid queries early in the development cycle.
- **Enhanced Developer Productivity:** Fluent APIs and field helpers reduce boilerplate, enabling you to focus on business logic.
- **Elegant Query Construction:** Intuitive interfaces make complex SQL templates readable and maintainable.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Leverages your existing GORM ecosystem without friction.

---

## What Are the Core Features?

### 1. Generation of Type-Safe Query APIs from Go Interfaces

You define interfaces with SQL templates embedded in method comments, and GORM CLI generates concrete implementations that guarantee type safety.

For example, an interface method like:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

produces a strongly typed query method that fetches records by `id`, seamlessly binding your Go parameter.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers

From your struct models, GORM CLI generates field helpers for filters, updates, ordering, and associations. These helpers provide rich predicates and setters:

```go
generated.User.Name.Eq("Alice")     // WHERE name = 'Alice'
generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)  // WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 65
```

This ensures your queries leverage the exact field definitions, guarding against typos and mismatches.

### 3. Robust Association Operations

GORM CLI supports complex association manipulation directly via the generated helpers, making operations such as creating, updating, unlinking, or deleting related entities intuitive and type-safe.

Examples include:

- Creating and linking associations in one fluent call.
- Updating nested associations with filtering.
- Unlinking associations to clear foreign keys.
- Batch creation of related entities.

This sharpens your ability to reflect real-world data relationships with minimal code.

### 4. Seamless Integration with GORM

Built on top of `gorm.io/gorm`, the generated APIs integrate directly with the GORM DB instance, fully compatible with GORM’s rich features like transactions, hooks, and scopes.

Use familiar GORM patterns while enjoying added compile-time guarantees and discoverability.

## How These Features Translate Into Real Benefits

| Benefit                   | Description                                                                             | Example Use Case                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Compile-Time SQL Validation | Errors in SQL templates or parameter bindings surface before you run your application. | Catch missing parameters or invalid syntax early. |
| Fluent API Usability        | Developers navigate fields and queries with rich IDE autocomplete.                     | Build complex filters and updates effortlessly.  |
| Faster Development Cycle    | Reduce the time spent debugging query issues and writing repetitive code.             | Focus on logic instead of SQL string formatting. |
| Accurate Associations       | Manage related records with precise control and safe operations.                       | Create user and linked pets in one go.            |

Before GORM CLI, building such type-safe, flexible query APIs with fluent associations often meant writing excessive boilerplate or manually syncing models and query code. With GORM CLI, this is automated and guaranteed.

## Real-World User Flow

1. Define your Go interface with SQL template annotations for your queries.
2. Write your models as Go structs.
3. Run the `gorm gen` command to generate the query APIs and field helpers.
4. Use the generated APIs in your application with strong typing and IDE assistance.
5. Leverage association operations to manage complex relationships without raw SQL.

This workflow makes your data layer maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Wildcard Patterns in Config:** Limit generation to relevant interfaces using `IncludeInterfaces` for faster build and cleaner code.
- **Map Custom Field Types:** Use `FieldTypeMap` and `FieldNameMap` in config to generate support for custom types like JSON or nullable time.
- **Leverage Template DSL:** Embed dynamic conditions and iterations in your SQL templates for complex querying needs.
- **Combine Query and Field Helper Usage:** Use the generated query APIs alongside the field helpers for maximum expressiveness.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- **Missing Generated Methods:** Ensure your interfaces contain correctly formatted SQL comments and are included in config filters.
- **Type Mismatches:** Confirm your model struct fields and method parameter types align; review your field maps for custom types.
- **Unintended File Generation Paths:** Double-check the `OutPath` and generation config to avoid misplaced files.

## Getting Started Preview

To experience these features, start by:

- Writing a Go interface with query methods annotated by SQL templates.
- Defining your GORM model structs.
- Running the CLI generation tool `gorm gen -i ./your_input_path -o ./your_output_path`.

Generated code output includes concrete query implementations, strongly typed field helpers, and association helpers — ready for immediate use.
