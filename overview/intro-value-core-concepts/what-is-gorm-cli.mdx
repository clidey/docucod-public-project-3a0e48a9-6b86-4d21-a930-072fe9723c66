# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Fluent, Type-Safe Database Access for Go Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful code-generation tool designed specifically for Go developers working with GORM. It transforms your codebase by generating **type-safe, interface-driven query APIs** and **model-driven field helpers** that make database interactions more fluent, discoverable, and robust.

This page introduces GORM CLI, focusing on what it is, who it benefits, and why it is essential for building maintainable data access layers.

---

## What Is GORM CLI?

At its core, GORM CLI is a **code generator** that scans your Go project for specially designed interfaces and model structs, then produces ready-to-use, strongly typed APIs that wrap GORM database operations. This process radically reduces manual boilerplate and runtime errors.

- It analyzes your Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates to create **type-safe query methods**.
- It examines your data models to build **field helper types** for filters, updates, and associations.

These generated components combine to deliver a streamlined, fluent API that integrates seamlessly with GORM's core.

### The Problem It Solves

Go's static typing and interface strengths sometimes collide with the verbosity and error-proneness of raw SQL and query construction. GORM CLI tackles this pain point by:

- Eliminating string-based SQL mistakes with **compile-time type checking**.
- Encouraging reusable, interface-driven query definitions.
- Generating expressive model helpers that make it easy to express conditions and update statements.

This removes guesswork, saves time, and scales cleanly as your application grows.

### What Makes GORM CLI Unique?

- **Fluent, Discoverable APIs:** Generated code exposes clear, idiomatic methods and properties that guide you as you build queriesâ€”no guesswork.
- **Interface-Driven Queries:** You define behavior declaratively in interfaces; GORM CLI generates robust implementations automatically.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Beyond queries, it generates field helpers that precisely type your model fields, including complex associations.
- **Compile-Time Safety:** You catch errors early, preventing runtime surprises in your data access.
- **Configurable and Extensible:** With optional package-level config, you control inclusion rules, output paths, and type mappings.

## How Does GORM CLI Work at a High Level?

GORM CLI processes your project files to:

1. **Parse Interfaces:** Reads Go interfaces that include SQL template comments, extracting method signatures and SQL fragments.
2. **Parse Models:** Reads Go structs to understand data fields and relationships.
3. **Apply Generation Config:** Honors package-level configurations to include/exclude certain interfaces or structs and customize mappings.
4. **Generate Code:** Outputs Go source files with:
    - Concrete implementations of your query interfaces,
    - Field helpers for all model fields,
    - Association helpers for linked data models.

This means your existing Go code acts as the source of truth for generating reliable, maintainable database access layers, ensuring your data access evolves smoothly alongside your application.

## Who Should Care About GORM CLI?

- **Go Backend Developers:** Anyone building APIs or services using GORM who wants safer, more expressive data access
- **Teams Maintaining Complex Data Layers:** Projects that need consistent, maintainable query layers with fewer bugs
- **Developers Needing Scalable Query APIs:** Those who write repetitive or complex SQL queries and want to automate and optimize

Whether you are just starting a new project or refactoring an existing one, GORM CLI helps you write cleaner, safer, and more maintainable code.

## Getting Started Preview

To start leveraging GORM CLI, you typically:

- Define your query interfaces with embedded SQL templates in method comments.
- Declare your data models as usual.
- Run `gorm gen -i <input-path> -o <output-path>` to generate the code.
- Use the generated APIs to build fluent, type-safe queries and updates.

Next, explore the [Core Features and Value Proposition](/overview/intro-value-core-concepts/core-features-and-value) page to discover how GORM CLI transforms your workflows and accelerates development.

## Summary

GORM CLI empowers Go developers to write efficient, maintainable database code by generating type-safe query APIs and field helpers from interfaces and models. Its interface-driven approach combined with fluent API generation provides a reliable development experience that keeps you productive and error-free.

## Example: Defining a Query Interface

Here's a glimpse at how you define an interface to let GORM CLI generate a fluent query API:

```go
// Query defines a type-safe interface for user-related queries
// with SQL template annotations.
type Query[T any] interface {
  // GetByID returns a user by their ID.
  //
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // FilterByNameAndAge returns users filtered by name and age.
  //
  // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
}
```

GORM CLI processes this interface to generate an implementation with methods you can call directly.

---

## Example: Fluent Query Usage

After generation, using the APIs looks natural and intuitive:

```go
// Fetch a user by ID, safely typed
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Filter users by name and age dynamically
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge("jinzhu", 25).Find(ctx)
```

This type safety reduces risk and helps your IDE guide you through method signatures and parameters.
