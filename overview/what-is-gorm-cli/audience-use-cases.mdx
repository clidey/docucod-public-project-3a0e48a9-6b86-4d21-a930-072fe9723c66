# Target Audience & Use Cases

Discover who benefits most from GORM CLI, including Go engineers building data-intensive applications, teams prioritizing safety and maintainability, and those seeking a seamless extension to GORM workflows. Review common use cases such as rapid CRUD API generation, type-safe data operations, and field/association management.

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed specifically for Go developers and teams who want to bring greater **type safety**, **clarity**, and **efficiency** to their database coding with GORM. If you are working with backend services or data-intensive applications where correctness and maintainability of database access is critical, this tool empowers you to write more confident and cleaner database query code.

### Ideal Users:

- **Go Backend Engineers:** Building and maintaining Go applications that interact extensively with relational databases via GORM.
- **Development Teams:** Organizations that want to enforce consistent patterns, reduce runtime errors, and boost developer productivity.
- **GORM Users Seeking Safety:** Developers who want to go beyond raw SQL strings and gain compile-time validation and discoverable APIs over their database operations.
- **API and Service Builders:** Those who want to quickly scaffold robust CRUD APIs with minimal repetitive boilerplate.

## Why Users Choose GORM CLI

### Ensures Type-Safe Query Interfaces
GORM CLI converts Go interface methods annotated with SQL templates into fully typed query implementations. This eliminates 
common bugs caused by SQL string mismatches or incorrect parameter usage.

### Fluent Model-Driven Field Helpers
Generated field helpers map your model structs to expressive predicates and setters, making query building and updates more intuitive and error-proof.

### Streamlines Association Handling
GORM CLI provides operations for related data associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many2many), all with compile-time safety.

### Customizable and Extensible
Using `genconfig.Config`, you can tailor code generation to your project's needs â€” whether restricting generation to specific files, renaming fields, or integrating JSON and custom data types.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Rapid CRUD API Generation
Write simple Go interfaces representing queries with SQL templates, and generate both queries and updates automatically. This reduces hours of manual query coding and testing.

```go
// examples/query.go
// Interface method with SQL template
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)
```

Generated methods provide seamless and type-safe implementations for operations like Get, Filter, Update, Create, and Delete.

### 2. Type-Safe Data Filtering and Updates
Leverage model-driven field helpers to compose complex predicates and updates with compiler assurance.

```go
// Find users with age > 18
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)

// Update user's name safely
err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).Set(generated.User.Name.Set("alice")).Update(ctx)
```

### 3. Advanced Association Management
Manage related records securely and fluently, such as creating linked entities, batch linking, unlinking, or conditional deletes.

```go
// Create user with pet linked
err := gorm.G[User](db).Set(
  generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
  generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
).Create(ctx)
```

### 4. Complex Conditional and Template-Driven Queries
Write dynamic SQL templates inside interface comments using directives like `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` to control conditional filters and updates.

```go
// SQL template with conditional where expression
// SELECT * FROM @@table
// {{where}}
//   {{if name != ""}} name=@name {{end}}
// {{end}}
FilterByName(name string) ([]User, error)
```

This allows building flexible queries while retaining static typing and safety.

## Before & After GORM CLI Adoption

| Without GORM CLI                                | With GORM CLI                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Manual SQL string management with risk errors | Compile-time checked, type-safe query methods      |
| Verbose boilerplate code for CRUD operations  | Auto-generated, discoverable APIs from interfaces  |
| Difficult to manage relations manually        | Fluent, consistent association helpers             |
| Error-prone updates and filter conditions     | Model-driven field helpers with clear semantics    |

---

## Maximizing Your Success

- Start by defining clean Go interface methods with embedded SQL templates.
- Generate code using `gorm gen` with your interfaces and models.
- Use generated APIs for all your query and update needs for safer, faster development.
- Customize field mappings or inclusions through `genconfig.Config` to fit your project.
