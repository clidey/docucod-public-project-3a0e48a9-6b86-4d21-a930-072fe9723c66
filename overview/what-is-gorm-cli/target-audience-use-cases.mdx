# Target Audience & Common Use Cases

## Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is meticulously designed for **Go developers working with GORM-based projects** who want to elevate their productivity and enforce type-safe, efficient data access layers. If your daily workflow involves managing complex database queries, crafting APIs rapidly, and maintaining reliable data integrity with minimal boilerplate, GORM CLI is tailored to your needs.

### Typical Users
- **Backend developers** building RESTful or gRPC APIs with Go and GORM.
- **Teams maintaining large codebases** where compile-time safety prevents runtime query errors.
- **Architects and technical leads** who want consistent, scalable database access patterns.
- **Go programmers seeking to automate and customize code generation** for complex models and relationships.

## Core Scenarios Where GORM CLI Excels

GORM CLI’s design focuses on the everyday challenges faced by Go developers engaging with database-driven applications. Here are the most valuable use cases where it shines:

### 1. Rapid API Development With Type-Safe Query Interfaces

By writing simple Go interfaces annotated with concise SQL templates, you generate fully typed, ready-to-use query APIs. This empowers you to avoid repetitive CRUD boilerplate and confidently interact with your data using idiomatic Go code.

#### Example:
```go
// Define a query interface with SQL template comments
type QueryUser[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  ByID(id int) (T, error)
}

// Generated usage:
user, err := generated.QueryUser[User](db).ByID(ctx, 123)
```
This approach cuts down on errors and manual coding by ensuring your queries are consistent, discoverable, and validated at compile time.

### 2. Enforcing Query Safety With Compile-Time Validation

GORM CLI automatically injects context and strongly types all generated methods. This eliminates a common pain point of runtime SQL errors or mismatched parameters by catching discrepancies during compilation.

### 3. Reducing Boilerplate for Model-Driven Field Helpers

Beyond query interfaces, GORM CLI generates rich, field-level helpers for filters, updates, and association management directly from your model structs.

#### Real-World Benefits
- Fluent query construction with predicates like `.Eq()`, `.Incr()`, `.Between()`, and advanced JSON field operations.
- Association operations (e.g., create, update, unlink, delete) that respect your relational schema with clear semantics for belongs-to, has-many, and many-to-many types.

### 4. Customizing Code Generation to Match Complex Data Models

Complex projects often need tailored code generation. With `genconfig.Config`, you can:
- Include/exclude specific interfaces or structs using shell-style patterns.
- Map Go types to custom field helpers (e.g., JSON fields).
- Adjust file-level generation scope.

This flexibility helps match your domain-specific needs and coding standards effortlessly.

## Putting It All Together: Benefits You Can Expect

- **Faster Development:** Automate repetitive tasks to focus on business logic.
- **Higher Code Quality:** Early detection of errors through type safety.
- **Consistent APIs:** Unified access patterns cut bugs and ease onboarding.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** Change your models and regenerate clean, updated APIs.

## Common Use Cases in Practice

|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Rapid prototype API development | Generate query APIs from interfaces with SQL templates.     | Quickly build reliable data access layers.               |
| Dynamic filtering and updates   | Use model-driven helpers for advanced predicate building.  | Write expressive and safe queries without manual SQL.    |
| Complex association management  | Perform Create, Update, Unlink, Delete operations easily.   | Maintain relational integrity with minimal code.          |
| Customized generation control   | Use `genconfig.Config` to control generator behavior.      | Tailor generated code to align with project conventions.  |

## Before and After GORM CLI Adoption

| Without GORM CLI                         | With GORM CLI                                             |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Manually write repetitive query methods | Define interface once, generate safe, type-checked APIs |
| Risk runtime SQL injection or errors    | Compile-time binding and templating with SQL templates   |
| Tedious association management           | Fluent, method-chained association helpers                 |
| Inconsistent access patterns across code| Unified, discoverable, fluent APIs for all models          |

## Getting Started Preview

Begin by defining your query interfaces and data models in Go, then run `gorm gen` to generate your tailored type-safe APIs and helpers. Detailed steps and examples are available in the [Quickstart Workflow](/overview/getting-started-examples/quickstart-workflow) and [Using the Generated APIs](/getting-started/config-gen-first-run/using-generated) documentation.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or higher for generics support.
- GORM installed and your models properly defined.

### Next Steps
