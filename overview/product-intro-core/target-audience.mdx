# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

## Unlocking Safer, Strongly Typed Database Access for Go Backend Engineers and Teams

GORM CLI is designed for Go backend developers who want to enhance their productivity, code safety, and query ergonomics through powerful code generation. Whether you're an individual engineer or part of a team adopting GORM for your projects, this page clarifies who benefits most from using GORM CLI and why it fits perfectly into your development workflow.

## Understanding the Ideal Users of GORM CLI

### Target Audience

- **Go Backend Engineers:** Developers building server-side applications that interact with SQL databases using GORM. You write Go models and interfaces and want to reduce boilerplate while gaining type-safe query methods.

- **Teams Adopting GORM:** Engineering teams standardizing on GORM who need consistent, maintainable, and safer database access patterns across multiple projects or microservices.

- **Projects Prioritizing Strong Typing and Safety:** Systems where compile-time validation prevents costly runtime errors, especially those with complex queries, associations, or frequent schema evolution.

### Typical User Profiles

- **The Interface-Driven Architect:** You define Go interfaces with SQL templates, leaning on GORM CLI to generate fully typed query APIs that eliminate manual SQL stitching.

- **The Model-Focused Developer:** You want convenient, model-driven field helpers for filtering, updating, and managing associations without hand-coding repetitive query logic.

- **The Team Lead or Architect:** You aim to enforce safe querying standards via generated code, ensuring consistency and reducing human error in your codebase.

- **The Open Source Contributor or Library Writer:** Your code needs to be reusable and robust with query APIs that adapt to evolving models and interfaces.

## Why GORM CLI Fits Your Project

### Benefits That Address Your Needs

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Detect SQL and query mismatches before running your code, preventing runtime panics and silent errors.

- **Boosted Developer Productivity:** Generate verbatim implementations from your interfaces with zero boilerplate — write less, do more.

- **Stronger Typing:** Enjoy intuitive, fluent APIs for writing queries and managing model associations without type assertions or manual SQL string handling.

- **Consistent Codebase:** Automated generation leads to uniform query APIs and helpers, making your code easier to read and maintain.

- **Flexible Query Customization:** Leverage SQL templating DSL embedded in interface comments to cover diverse and dynamic querying scenarios.

### Optimal Project Scenarios

- Applications with complex business logic accessing relational databases.
- Systems where updating and deleting associations safely is mission critical.
- Services undergoing continuous schema changes where manual query maintenance is costly.
- Greenfield projects aiming to build resilient, clean data access layers from the start.

## Relatable User Flow: From Interface to Type-Safe Querying

1. **Define Your Models:** Start by writing Go structs for your database tables.
2. **Declare Query Interfaces:** Create interfaces with SQL templates describing your queries.
3. **Run GORM CLI:** Generate complete, type-safe query APIs and field helpers.
4. **Use Generated Code:** Integrate fluent queries with confidence in compile-time checks.

This flow reduces error-prone manual SQL crafting and unlocks explorer-friendly code completion.

## Practical Examples of Who Uses GORM CLI

### Example 1: A Go Backend Engineer

```go
// Define a simple query interface
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
func GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Implemented by generated code - no manual SQL handling needed
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

### Example 2: A Team Using Complex Associations

```go
// Generated association helpers allow safe batch creation
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.CreateInBatch([]Pet{{Name: "fido"}, {Name: "rex"}}),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

These examples illustrate how developers benefit by writing simple interface methods and using generated code with strong typing, avoiding common pitfalls in SQL string construction.

## Common Pitfalls GORM CLI Helps Avoid

- Forgetting to update query strings after schema changes.
- Runtime errors from mismatched types in queries.
- Writing unsafe, untested raw SQL embedded in business logic.
- Complex association updates causing inconsistent state.

By generating code from interfaces and models, GORM CLI enforces correctness early.
