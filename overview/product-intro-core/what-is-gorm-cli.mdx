# What is GORM CLI?

## Empowering Go Developers with Type-Safe Database APIs

GORM CLI transforms how Go developers interact with databases by automatically generating **type-safe query APIs** and **model-driven field helpers** from your Go source code. Built to seamlessly extend the acclaimed GORM ORM ecosystem, GORM CLI bridges the gap between raw SQL flexibility and compile-time safety.

By focusing on your Go interfaces annotated with raw SQL templates and your Go model structs, GORM CLI generates robust, discoverable APIs that let you write powerful, safe database queries and updates with confidence and ease.

## What Exactly is GORM CLI?

At its core, GORM CLI is a **code generator** that parses your Go interface definitions containing SQL templates and your data model structs to produce:

- **Interface-driven query APIs**: Strongly typed methods implementing your SQL templates for safe, intuitive data access
- **Model-driven field helpers**: Fluent, compile-time validated fields and association helpers for building GORM query clauses, updates, and associations

It eliminates the need to manually write repetitive, error-prone SQL query code by leveraging Go’s generics and AST parsing.

This approach offers a maintainable, productive workflow where SQL lives close to your code and benefits from Go’s type system.

## Why GORM CLI Matters to You

When building Go applications that use relational databases, developers often face several challenges:

- **Unsafe, string-based SQL queries** that risk runtime errors and injection flaws
- **Tedious and repetitive query code** with limited discoverability
- **Difficulty maintaining complex queries and associations**

GORM CLI solves these by letting you **write declarative Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates**, then automatically generating type-safe implementations and helpers. Your application code becomes more readable, reliable, and maintainable.

With GORM CLI:

- Your queries are validated at compile time
- You work directly with Go types, avoiding manual mapping
- Field helpers enable expressive and composable predicates for filtering and updates
- Association helpers manage complex relations with clear semantics

## How GORM CLI Works at a Glance

1. **Define Go Interfaces with SQL Templates:**
   Write Go interfaces where method comments contain raw SQL or templated SQL using a simple DSL.

2. **Define Your Data Models:**
   Use your existing GORM model structs or create new ones.

3. **Run the Generator:**
   Invoke `gorm gen` pointed at your interface files. It parses your input, extracts the SQL templates, and generates ready-to-use type-safe methods.

4. **Use Generated APIs:**
   Call your generated interfaces in code with full Go type safety. Compose queries with generated field helpers for filtering, updating, and managing associations.

This transforms raw methods and structs into fluent, discoverable APIs with minimal effort.

## Real-World Example

Consider a simple user query interface:

```go
// Query defines common SQL queries for users
// The SQL templates are written inside method comments

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE name=@name AND age>@age
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int) ([]T, error)
}
```

After running the generator, you instantly get a fully typed API:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterByNameAndAge(ctx, "alice", 18)
```

No manual SQL string concatenation, no unsafe query building.

Similarly, your model `User` generates field helpers:

```go
generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")          // builds `name = 'alice'`
generated.User.Age.Gt(18)                 // builds `age > 18`
```

These helpers integrate directly with GORM’s query builder.

## Seamless Integration with GORM

GORM CLI is built to extend GORM’s elegance:

- Uses GORM’s `gorm.DB` as the entry point for generated APIs
- Supports GORM’s schema tags and associations
- Field and association helpers are fully compatible with GORM expressions
- Generated code is idiomatic Go and integrates naturally into existing GORM projects

This results in a unified developer experience combining the best of type-safe DSLs and raw SQL power.

---

## Benefits at a Glance

- **Eliminate SQL string errors:** By binding SQL templates to typed Go methods
- **Boost productivity:** Automatic generation of query methods and helpers
- **Improve code quality:** Compile-time checks and discoverable APIs
- **Simplify maintenance:** Changes in interfaces or models flow through generated code
- **Support advanced queries:** Supports dynamic SQL with templating, conditional clauses, and iteration
