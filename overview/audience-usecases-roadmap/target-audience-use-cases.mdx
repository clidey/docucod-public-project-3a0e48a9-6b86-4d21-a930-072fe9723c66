# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is meticulously designed for Go developers focused on delivering **type-safe, productive, and maintainable data access layers** within GORM-powered applications. This page clarifies precisely who benefits most from GORM CLI and why it becomes an indispensable tool for those crafting robust database queries and structured query APIs.

## Introducing the Ideal User

If you are a Go developer working with GORM and your priority includes:

- Eliminating the friction of runtime errors caused by SQL syntax or mismatched parameters
- Increasing productivity by generating type-safe query methods from declarative Go interfaces
- Enforcing structured, contract-safe queries that are easy to review and maintain
- Generating expressive and reusable field helpers directly from your models for filters, updates, and association operations

then GORM CLI is built for you.

### Typical Users Include:

- **Backend Developers** building and maintaining complex data access layers
- **Teams** who require compile-time assurances to reduce bugs and improve code clarity
- **Architects** enforcing consistent query patterns and coding standards across projects
- **Developers** needing flexible yet type-safe template-driven SQL query generation


## Common Real-World Use Cases

This section explores scenarios where GORM CLI shines, showcasing its usefulness in practical contexts.

### 1. Building Large, Type-Safe Data Access Layers

When working on projects with numerous query interfaces and models, manually writing consistent SQL queries can become cumbersome and error-prone. GORM CLI allows you to define your queries declaratively in interfaces with SQL templates, then automatically generates robust, type-checked APIs that prevent common mistakes like:

- Parameter mismatches
- Unsafe dynamic SQL injections
- Incorrect column references

Example:

```go
// Define a query interface with SQL annotations
 type Query[T any] interface {
     // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
     GetByID(id int) (T, error)
 }
```

The generator produces straightforward, type-safe methods you can call with confidence.

### 2. Enforcing Query Contract Safety Across Teams

Queries defined as interfaces serve as contracts. This eliminates informal, embedded string SQL scattered across codebases. With GORM CLI:

- Interfaces act as explicit, discoverable APIs
- Generated methods guarantee input parameters match expected query variables
- Centralized query definitions simplify code reviews and refactoring

### 3. Need for Expressive Field Helpers for Filtering, Updating, and Associations

The generator creates fluent field helper variables from your model structs. These helpers empower you to write:

- Strongly typed filters (e.g., `.Age.Between(18,65)`)
- Safe, composable update sets including zero-values or expressions
- Association operations like create, unlink, batch create with compile-time validation

Example:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Set(generated.User.Name.Set("alice")).
  Update(ctx)
```

### 4. Enabling Dynamic and Conditional Queries via SQL Template DSL

If your project requires generating queries with conditional logic or iteration, the template DSL allows embedding Go templating in SQL comments inside interfaces. This enables expressive, maintainable, dynamic queries without losing type safety.

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table
// {{where}}
//   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
//   {{if user.Age > 0}} AND age=@user.Age {{end}}
// {{end}}
SearchUsers(user User) ([]T, error)
```


## Why Does This Matter?

Without tools like GORM CLI, developers often face:

- Fragile query code prone to runtime errors
- Repetitive boilerplate for basic CRUD and filters
- Difficulty in maintaining and evolving query codebases
- Reduced developer productivity and increased bug surface

GORM CLI addresses these pain points head-on, enabling you to:

- **Capture query intent in code:** Interfaces coupled with SQL templates communicate the data access layer clearly.
- **Increase development velocity:** Auto-generated code frees you from manual repetitive tasks.
- **Deliver strong compile-time guarantees:** Your queries are validated against expected inputs and outputs.
- **Improve code discoverability:** Auto-generated helpers are easy to navigate and use.


## How This Fits Into Your Workflow

GORM CLI integrates seamlessly into GORM-based projects by generating:

- **Type-safe query APIs** from interfaces you define
- **Field helpers** from your models for filters and updates

Use GORM CLI early in your development to scaffold a reliable foundation or incrementally integrate it to improve existing code quality.

For a step-by-step introduction, see the [Quickstart Workflow](../architecture-usage-integration/quickstart-workflow).


## Practical Tips for Adopting GORM CLI

- Define your query interfaces with clear SQL templates early.
- Annotate your models with tags if you require custom field mapping.
- Use the optional `genconfig.Config` to customize generation per package.
- Leverage the generated field helpers to write expressive, safe queries.
- Run the generator as part of your build process or CI pipeline.


## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Omitting input parameters that the query requires:** Always match interface method parameters to your SQL placeholders.
- **Neglecting `context.Context`:** The generator adds it automatically if missing, but including it explicitly supports better control.
- **Ignoring generation output location:** Use the `-o` flag to direct generated code to your desired project folder.


## Summary

You should use GORM CLI if you’re a Go developer working with GORM who values:

- Type safety and productivity in data access code
- Structured, contract-driven query generation
- Expressive field helpers for filters, updates, and associations
- Advanced templating for dynamic query building

Adopting GORM CLI empowers your projects with robust, maintainable, and efficient database interaction capabilities.
