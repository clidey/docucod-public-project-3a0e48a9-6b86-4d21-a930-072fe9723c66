# Next Steps and Learning Journey

Welcome to the gateway beyond the initial introduction and core concepts of GORM CLI. This page is your personalized roadmap to deepen hands-on expertise, explore meaningful examples, and master advanced reference materials — all tailored to your experience level and learning interests.

---

## Why This Page Matters

Once you understand what GORM CLI is and grasp its foundational workflow, you might wonder: _What’s next?_ How can I confidently apply it, troubleshoot, and extend it to real-world projects?

This page answers those questions by guiding you toward practical guides, example-driven learning, and focused documentation that make your learning curve smooth and effective.

---

## What You Will Find Here

### 1. Hands-On Guides
Jump into structured tutorials that walk you through each step of defining models and interfaces, generating code, and integrating the results in real GORM projects.

**Examples include:**
- Building your first type-safe queries
- Working with associations effectively
- Customizing generation through configuration

These guides build your confidence by showing you step-by-step workflows and best practices.

### 2. Example-Driven Learning
Explore curated example repositories and snippets that highlight practical usage patterns and advanced features:

- Query interfaces with SQL template DSL
- Complex model configurations
- Advanced field helper extensions (e.g., JSON support)

Real examples help you understand the "why" and "how" beyond API reference.

### 3. In-Depth Reference Material
For those ready to dive deeper or troubleshoot, you'll find detailed documentation on:

- The SQL template DSL syntax and common patterns
- Configuration options for filtering, custom mappings, and output paths
- Association semantics and how Create, Update, Unlink, and Delete operations behave

This ensures you have reliable answers when customizing or extending your use of GORM CLI.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Follow a progressive learning curve:** Start with simple model and interface definitions, then incrementally add complexity.
- **Use examples as blueprints:** Modify existing snippets rather than starting from scratch.
- **Validate frequently:** Run your generated code tests early and often using provided test scripts.
- **Leverage configurations:** Fine-tune generation scope and field mappings via `genconfig.Config` declarations.
- **Embrace associations:** Understand how create/update/unlink/delete operations affect related models to avoid surprises.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Omitting the context parameter in interface methods — GORM CLI auto-injects but your signatures should accommodate it.
- Ignoring naming conventions in model fields that impact generated helpers.
- Overlooking file-level vs. package-level configuration effects.
- Running generation without ensuring your interfaces and models are correctly annotated.
