# Product Value & Benefits

## Accelerate Your Development with GORM CLI

Eliminate the tedious, error-prone task of writing handwritten query logic. GORM CLI empowers you to generate type-safe, expressive, and compile-time checked query APIs and helpers tailored exactly to your data models. This unlocks faster iteration cycles, safer database interactions, and dramatically easier onboarding for your team.

### Why GORM CLI Matters
- **Zero Handwritten Queries:** Automatically generate robust query methods from your Go interface SQL templates.
- **Type Safety at Compile Time:** Catch data access mistakes early, reducing runtime bugs and increasing stability.
- **Expressive, Fluent APIs:** Work with intuitive, discoverable method chains and field helpers that perfectly match your models.
- **Simplify Complex Operations:** Seamlessly handle association CRUD (create, update, unlink, delete) with built-in helpers.
- **Accelerate Onboarding:** New developers can quickly understand and use generated APIs instead of deciphering handwritten SQL scattered around the codebase.

This documentation page focuses exclusively on the *value* and *benefits* you gain by adopting GORM CLI — helping you understand why it’s worth integrating into your workflow.

## What Is This?

GORM CLI is a powerful code generator for GORM projects that creates two key components:

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Define your SQL queries declaratively in Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates, and get fully compiled, type-checked methods automatically generated.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** From your Go struct models, generate strongly typed helpers for filters, updates, and association operations that ensure fluent and error-resistant database work.

Together, these generated pieces dramatically streamline data access, eliminating the drag of manual query maintenance.

> Imagine never having to write raw SQL for common queries or worry about mismatched column names again. GORM CLI integrates natively with `gorm.io/gorm` to keep your workflow smooth and idiomatic.

## Key Benefits Explained

### 1. Eliminate Handwritten Query Logic
Writing SQL by hand invites mistakes—typos, mismatched parameter orders, or inconsistent query constructs. GORM CLI removes this burden by generating code directly from SQL templates in your Go interfaces:

```go
// Your query interface defines intent clearly
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)
```

Behind the scenes, this automates safe, performant execution with proper parameter binding.

### 2. Achieve Safer Data Operations Through Type Safety
The generated methods use Go's type system to ensure parameters, results, and updates align perfectly with your models. This compile-time checking prevents bugs such as:

- Passing incorrect types to queries
- Missing parameters
- Misusing update setters

### 3. Simplify Complex Database Interactions
GORM CLI generates helpers for associations (`hasOne`, `hasMany`, `belongsTo`, `many2many`). These helpers allow concise, readable operations like:

- Creating and linking related data in one step
- Safely unlinking or deleting associations with conditions
- Batch creating linked records

Your code becomes easier to read and maintain, replacing tricky manual joins or foreign key management.

### 4. Speed Up Developer Onboarding
New team members can dive straight into using generated APIs without delving into complex SQL or legacy handwritten code. The generated code is:

- Intuitive, following Go idioms
- Well-typed and discoverable in IDEs
- Documented through the interface definitions you maintain

### 5. Iterate Faster With Confidence
Because you declare queries in interfaces and models, changes propagate cleanly through generated code. You can confidently refactor models or queries knowing type checking will catch issues before runtime.

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

- **CRUD API Generation:** Define query interfaces for your REST endpoints and generate optimized, reusable methods per entity.
- **Batch Operations:** Create or update related child records atomically using generated association batch helpers.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Use template DSL features like conditional WHERE clauses and loops directly in your SQL annotations, to create flexible queries without custom builder logic.
- **Migration and Refactoring:** When models evolve, regeneration ensures all query methods adapt safely, minimizing bugs during schema changes.

### Before vs After GORM CLI
| Without GORM CLI                       | With GORM CLI                                   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Manually write raw SQL for every query | Write simple annotated Go interface; generate type-safe methods |
| Copy-paste brittle query building code | Fluent generated methods with full compile-time checks  |
| Mix query logic across files, hard to maintain | Clean separation: queries defined once, code generated anywhere |
| High likelihood of runtime SQL errors | Compile-time verification of SQL templates and parameter bindings |

## Achieving Productivity Gains and ROI

Users of GORM CLI report:
- **Significant reduction in manual query code** with streamlined interfaces
- **Fewer bugs related to SQL and data mismatch** thanks to generated type safety
- **Reduced ramp-up time for new developers**, accelerating team velocity
- **Faster iteration cycles**, enabling rapid prototyping or feature expansion

These benefits translate directly to cost savings and quality improvements.

## Getting Started Preview

To unlock these benefits, a typical journey involves:

1. **Defining your models:** Ensure you have Go structs representing your database schema.
2. **Writing query interfaces:** Annotate SQL in Go interface method comments using GORM CLI’s template DSL.
3. **Running the generator:** Execute the CLI to generate the query API and helpers.
4. **Using the generated code:** Import and call the generated methods in your application code.

Each step is supported by dedicated guidance in the documentation:

- [First Code Generation Workflow](getting-started/first-codegen-workflow/prepare-models-interfaces)
- [Using the Generated APIs](getting-started/first-codegen-workflow/using-generated-code)

<Tip>
Start small: begin with a single model and query interface. Generate code and see the immediate safety and usability improvements.
