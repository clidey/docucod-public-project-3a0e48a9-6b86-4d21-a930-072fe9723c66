# Key Benefits and Why It Matters

GORM CLI revolutionizes how Go developers interact with their relational databases by delivering fluent, type-safe APIs for both reading and writing data. This page explores the core benefits of using GORM CLI, highlighting how it accelerates development, reduces bugs, and clarifies code—especially for teams working with GORM and relational databases.

---

## Unlock Fluent and Type-Safe Query APIs

At the heart of GORM CLI is its ability to generate interface-driven, type-safe query APIs. Instead of dealing with raw SQL strings or manually writing repetitive query logic, developers write simple Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates. GORM CLI then produces concrete implementations, ensuring:

- **Compile-time safety:** Catch errors early by leveraging Go’s type system, preventing SQL injection and runtime failures.
- **Fluent API usage:** Interact with generated functions that naturally describe operations like filtering, updating, and querying models.
- **Consistent query building:** APIs auto-generate parameter bindings aligned with your models, eliminating manual parameter errors.

### Example Scenario
You want to fetch a user by ID but avoid unsafe concatenation or verbose boilerplate:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

Behind the scenes, this translates to a fully type-checked SQL call, safeguarding both your data and code.

## Model-Driven Field Helpers: Streamline Filters and Updates

GORM CLI complements query interfaces with **model-driven field helpers**—strongly typed constructs generated directly from your struct fields and associations. These helpers enable:

- **Expressive predicates:** Create SQL clauses such as equals, greater-than, LIKE, IN, and IS NULL with intuitive functions.
- **Rich updates:** Support setting values, incrementing counters, or building complex expressions with zero-value awareness.
- **Association management:** Handle related entities safely and intuitively with helpers for has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many relationships.

### Real-World Example
Update a user’s pets, adding a new pet while maintaining compile-time checks:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This approach guarantees correctness when managing complex relational data.

## Robust Configuration for Tailored Generation

Not all projects are alike, and GORM CLI respects that with a powerful configuration system:

- **Path control:** Customize output directories for your generated code.
- **Selective generation:** Include or exclude specific interfaces or structs based on your project needs.
- **Field mapping:** Map Go types or struct tags to specialized field helpers, such as custom JSON handling or time fields.
- **File-level granularity:** Choose whether config applies to the entire package or individual files.

This flexibility empowers teams to align generated code perfectly with existing codebases and conventions.

---

## Seamless Integration With the GORM Ecosystem

GORM CLI is designed to fit naturally into your GORM workflow:

- It generates types and helpers that extend GORM’s APIs and conventions.
- Association helpers directly reflect the relationships defined in your GORM models.
- The generated APIs integrate with GORM’s database context, query builder, and update mechanics.

This seamless synergy means you spend less time bridging gaps and more time implementing business logic.

## Why You Should Care: Tangible Benefits and Use Cases

### Primary Benefits

- **Accelerate development:** Write fewer boilerplate queries and focus on what matters.
- **Drastically reduce bugs:** Leverage compile-time checks for SQL statements and parameter bindings.
- **Increase code clarity:** Fluent, discoverable APIs encourage maintainable and readable codebases.
- **Handle complex associations safely:** Use generated association helpers to manage related data consistently.

### Common Use Cases

- Backend services needing type-safe and performant repository layers.
- Teams working with complex GORM models and associations.
- Projects requiring advanced query customization without sacrificing safety or readability.
- Multi-developer environments prioritizing maintainability and reducing runtime exceptions.

### Before and After Using GORM CLI

| Before GORM CLI                 | After GORM CLI                          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Writing raw SQL strings        | Writing interfaces with SQL templates |
| Manual parameter binding      | Generated APIs handle bindings safely |
| Handwritten association logic | Auto-generated association helpers   |
| Verbose error-prone queries   | Fluent, type-checked query methods    |

## Getting Started Preview

Embarking on your journey with GORM CLI involves just a few easy steps:

- **Write query interfaces** using SQL-templated Go methods.
- **Define your models** as usual in GORM structs.
- **Run the CLI generator** to produce type-safe query APIs and field helpers.
- **Use generated APIs** seamlessly in your application code.

For detailed instructions, see the [Getting Started with GORM CLI](../getting-started/first-steps/your-first-generation.md) guide.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Leverage the **configuration system** to tailor generated code to your project style and requirements.
- Use **association helpers** to avoid manual foreign key manipulation—this prevents common bugs.
- Start with simple query interfaces and gradually expand to full use of the template DSL features.
- Take advantage of **field helper predicates** to construct complex and expressive queries while maintaining clarity.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Topics">
<Accordion title="Generated Code Not Found or Outdated">
Ensure your generation command runs with the correct input path and output directory. Confirm no errors occurred during `gorm gen` execution.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Type Errors After Generation">
Verify your Go version meets `go 1.18+` requirements for generics support. Also check your model definitions match what the generator expects.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Association Helpers Not Generated">
Check your GORM model's association tags and ensure all relations are properly defined. Use the configuration to include/exclude structs if necessary.
</Accordion>
