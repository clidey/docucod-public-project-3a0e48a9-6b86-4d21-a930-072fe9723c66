# Target Audience & Use Cases

GORM CLI is designed specifically for Go developers who work extensively with databases through the GORM ORM. This page profiles the ideal users and illustrates real-world workflows where GORM CLI transforms database interactions into type-safe, intuitive, and maintainable code.

## Why GORM CLI Fits Your Needs

If you're a Go developer who values:

- **Strongly typed query APIs** that eliminate runtime SQL errors,
- The ability to **write expressive, composable queries with compile-time checks**,
- Seamless handling of **complex associations** in your data model,
- Accelerated development with **generated CRUD operations and model helpers**,

then GORM CLI is the perfect tool to enhance your productivity and code safety.


## Profiles of Ideal Users

### 1. Backend Developers Building GORM-Based Services

You are developing Go services using GORM for database access, juggling multiple models and complex relationships. You want:

- To avoid hand-writing and debugging raw SQL or unsafe query strings.
- Compile-time validation of query parameters to catch errors early.
- Clear, discoverable APIs for CRUD and association operations.

### 2. Developers Focused on Model-Centric Programming

Your applications revolve around rich domain models with nested associations such as has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many. You need tooling that:

- Automatically generates field helpers reflecting your models’ fields and relations.
- Enables fluent, type-safe filters, updates, and batch creations linked to your domain.
- Handles polymorphic associations effortlessly with generated helpers.

### 3. Teams Needing Rapid CRUD and Custom Query Generation

Your team prioritizes rapid development cycles. You require:

- Template-based query interfaces where you write simple SQL templates once and get type-safe APIs.
- Strong conventions that reduce boilerplate and inconsistencies.
- Configurability for fine-tuning model and interface code generation to fit your coding standards.

---

## Typical Use Cases & Workflows

Here are three common scenarios where GORM CLI proves invaluable.

### Use Case 1: Rapid CRUD API Generation

**Problem:** You want to quickly generate reliable CRUD APIs with safe queries without manually coding each method.

**With GORM CLI:**

- Define Go interfaces with SQL templates describing operations like `GetByID(id int)` or `FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)`.
- Declare your model structs as usual with GORM tags.
- Run the generator to produce type-safe API implementations and field helpers.
- Use the generated APIs in your code, enjoying autocompletion and compile-time correctness.

**Result:** You cut development time drastically and avoid runtime SQL errors.


### Use Case 2: Complex Query Templating with Type Safety

**Problem:** Your queries vary widely with dynamic filters and conditional SQL clauses. Writing these manually invites mistakes.

**With GORM CLI:**

- Use the SQL template DSL embedded in interface comments to express conditional and iterative query logic.
- The generator produces concrete methods that are checked at compile time.

**Example:**

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table
// {{where}}
//   {{if user.ID > 0}} WHERE id=@user.ID {{else if user.Name != ""}} WHERE name=@user.Name {{end}}
QueryWith(user models.User) (T, error)
```

This design enables dynamic SQL with guaranteed parameter safety and convenient generated query APIs.


### Use Case 3: Model-Driven Association Management

**Problem:** Complex data models with has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many associations are hard to manipulate safely.

**With GORM CLI:**

- Association field helpers are generated automatically.
- You can invoke operations like `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, and `Delete` on associations with type safety.

**Example:**

```go
// Create a User and associate Pets and Languages
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("polyglot"),
    generated.User.Pets.CreateInBatch([]models.Pet{{Name: "fluffy"}, {Name: "spot"}}),
    generated.User.Languages.CreateInBatch([]models.Language{{Code: "EN"}, {Code: "FR"}}),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This fluent syntax reduces boilerplate and errors in managing data relationships.

## Before and After GORM CLI

| Without GORM CLI | With GORM CLI |
|------------------|--------------|
| Write raw SQL strings prone to syntax and parameter binding errors | Define interfaces and generate type-safe query APIs with guaranteed correctness |
| Manually map results to structs, risking runtime crashes | Use generated field helpers and query methods discoverable in IDE |
| Tediously handle associations and FK updates | Fluent association helpers to create/update/unlink/delete related records safely |

The difference is substantial: increased confidence, fewer bugs, and faster iteration.

---

## Key Benefits at a Glance

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Errors in SQL and parameters surface during compilation, not at runtime.
- **Discoverable APIs:** Generated query and field helpers provide IDE autocompletion.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Rapid scaffolding of CRUD and complex queries.
- **Association Support:** Manage one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and polymorphic relations fluidly.
- **Customizable Generation:** Tailor the generator with config files for naming and field mappings.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin harnessing GORM CLI in your projects:

1. Define query interfaces with SQL templates and model structs in the same package.
2. Run the generator via CLI (`gorm gen -i ./path -o ./generated`) to create type-safe query APIs and helpers.
3. Import and use the generated code in your services for reads, writes, and association handling.

For detailed steps, see our [Generating and Using Type-Safe APIs](https://yourdocsite/overview/architecture-features-integration/feature-overview) and [Defining Query Interfaces & Models](https://yourdocsite/guides/getting-started-workflows/defining-interfaces-models).

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Consistently keep your model structs and query interfaces close for coherence.
- Use the SQL template DSL to clearly express complex or conditional queries.
- Leverage association field helpers to avoid manual FK management.
- Customize your generation through `genconfig.Config` to fit project patterns.
- Test generated APIs early to catch generation or template issues.

### Example: Typical API Method Definition

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)

// Usage:
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

Hands-on examples like this appear in the generated code helping you write safe and clear data operations.
