# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe, Fluent Database Queries and Helpers for Go GORM Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful code generator designed to transform your Go projects that use GORM into a more developer-friendly and robust experience. By generating type-safe, fluent query APIs and strongly typed field helpers directly from your Go models and query interfaces, GORM CLI eliminates guesswork, reduces runtime errors, and accelerates your development workflow.

### Why GORM CLI Matters to You

Imagine a development environment where writing database queries feels as natural and safe as calling any Go function. No more stringly-typed queries vulnerable to typos, no tedious and error-prone manual SQL crafting. GORM CLI empowers you with auto-generated, discoverable APIs tailored precisely to your schema and your query intentions.

### Who Benefits from GORM CLI?

- Go developers building or maintaining projects with GORM
- Teams craving safer database queries with compile-time guarantees
- Projects needing streamlined, maintainable data access layers

## What is GORM CLI?

At its core, GORM CLI is a command-line tool that generates two complementary artifacts to enhance your GORM projects:

1. **Interface-driven Type-Safe Query APIs:** You write Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates. GORM CLI automatically generates concrete implementations that provide type-safe, fluent, and discoverable methods for querying your database.

2. **Model-driven Field Helpers:** From your Go struct models, GORM CLI generates strongly typed field helpers. These helpers simplify constructing queries, updates, and managing associations by offering expressive predicates and setters tied to your model’s fields.

Together, they give you a seamless integration with GORM, enabling you to craft complex queries and updates through a type-safe API that your IDE understands and your compiler verifies.

## The Core Purpose

GORM CLI solves a crucial problem: how to safely and efficiently query databases in Go with GORM while maintaining fluency, discoverability, and compile-time type safety. Instead of crafting raw SQL strings or relying solely on GORM's reflection-based API, you express your queries as Go interfaces with SQL templates. The generator then produces code that ensures those queries are strongly typed and context-aware.

This approach reduces runtime failures, improves code readability, and boosts developer productivity by catching errors early and providing rich autocompletions.

## Distinctive Advantages of GORM CLI

- **Type Safety with Generics:** Harness Go’s generics to provide parameterized query interfaces and field helpers that work seamlessly across your models.
- **SQL Template Parsing:** Write natural SQL embedded in Go interface comments with powerful templating directives to express conditional logic and iterations.
- **Auto-Generated Fluent APIs:** Gain intuitive, discoverable methods for querying, filtering, updating, and working with associations.
- **Configurable Generation:** Tailor generation via configuration files (`genconfig.Config`) to include/exclude specific interfaces or structs, map custom field types, and specify output paths.

## How GORM CLI Works at a High Level

1. **Input Definition:** You define Go interfaces with SQL-templated method comments and provide struct models that represent your database schema.
2. **Code Generation:** Running `gorm gen` parses your inputs, applies configurations, and generates corresponding Go code files containing concrete query implementations and field helpers.
3. **Development Use:** You import the generated packages and interact with your database through the newly created type-safe APIs.

By harnessing Go's powerful AST parsing and templating abilities, GORM CLI bridges your abstract query definitions to executable, safe code.

## Real-World Example

Consider a common scenario where you want to query a user by ID safely:

```go
// Define your query interface with SQL template
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
func GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

Running GORM CLI generates a method you can call like this:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

This approach ensures:
- The `id` parameter is strictly an `int`.
- The returned `user` matches your `User` struct.
- Your IDE surfaces autocompletion and type checks.

You no longer write raw SQL strings repeatedly; instead, you get compiler-verified query methods generated for you.

## Why You Should Care

- **Eliminate Runtime Query Errors:** With compile-time type checking, your queries are more reliable.
- **Accelerate Development:** Less boilerplate and clearer APIs let you build features faster.
- **Enhance Maintainability:** Generated code follows consistent patterns reducing cognitive load.
- **Boost Readability:** Your query intents are expressed clearly in Go interfaces rather than obscure strings.

By adopting GORM CLI, you elevate your Go-GORM project to a new standard of safety, clarity, and developer experience.

## Getting Started Preview

To start using GORM CLI:

1. Define your query interfaces with SQL templates and model structs.
2. Run the CLI with `gorm gen -i ./path_to_interfaces -o ./generated`.
3. Integrate the generated code into your project and enjoy fluent, type-safe data access.

For detailed configuration and usage, explore the [Generating and Using Type-Safe APIs](../guides/getting-started-workflows/generating-using-apis) and [Defining Query Interfaces & Models](../guides/getting-started-workflows/defining-interfaces-models) pages.
