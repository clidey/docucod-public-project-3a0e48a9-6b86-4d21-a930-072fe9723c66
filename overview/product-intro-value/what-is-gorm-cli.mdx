# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Powerful, Type-Safe Code Generation for Go

GORM CLI is a sophisticated command-line tool designed specifically for Go developers using the GORM ORM. It transforms your Go interfaces and models into fluent, type-safe APIs that significantly reduce repetitive code and runtime errors. By generating code that directly reflects your data models and query intentions, it streamlines database interactions and enhances developer confidence.

### Why GORM CLI Matters

- **Eliminate Boilerplate:** Automatically generate query APIs and field helpers so you can focus on business logic rather than routine SQL constructions.
- **Gain Compile-Time Safety:** Static typing enforces correctness before you run your application, catching errors early in the development cycle.
- **Fluent and Discoverable APIs:** Navigate your data and relationships with intuitive, generated methods and helpers tailored to your application’s models.
- **Seamless Go and GORM Integration:** Tailored to complement `gorm.io/gorm` workflows with minimal setup.

### Intended For

GORM CLI is ideal for Go developers who want to enhance productivity and reliability when interacting with databases using GORM. Whether building simple CRUD apps or complex relational data handling, it empowers teams to write cleaner, safer, and expressive database code.

## What is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is an advanced code generation tool that ingests your Go interfaces annotated with raw SQL templates alongside your Go struct-based models. It outputs two powerful elements:

1. **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Based on your interface methods and embedded SQL templates, it generates concrete implementations that are fully typed and safe to use.
2. **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** From your GORM model structs, it generates strongly typed helpers for filtering, updating, ordering, and managing associations.

Together, these generated components create a fluent, discoverable API that bridges the gap between Go’s type system and SQL, preventing errors and reducing the friction of database CRUD operations.

### The Problem It Solves

Manual SQL queries and ORM usage often lead to boilerplate code, inconsistent query patterns, and runtime failures caused by mismatched types or incorrect field names. GORM CLI solves this by:

- Converting declarative SQL templates into Go interface methods with implementations generated automatically.
- Delivering field-level helpers tightly bound to your model’s fields and associations, so database operations are intuitive and safe.

### What Sets GORM CLI Apart

- **SQL Template DSL:** Write raw SQL with dynamic templating directly within Go interface comments. GORM CLI parses these templates and generates query functions.
- **Association Safety:** Full typed support for creating, updating, unlinking, and deleting related entities with compile-time checks.
- **Field Helpers for All Supported Types:** Including basic types, nullable types, time, and custom types mapped through configuration.
- **Configurable Generation:** Customize output paths, field mappings, and inclusion/exclusion rules effortlessly.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Interface-Driven Query API Generation
Write Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates in method comments, and GORM CLI generates fully typed query APIs.

```go
// Query Interface Example
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

- Supports raw SQL with placeholders for safe parameter binding.
- Automatically injects context.Context if missing.
- Enables conditional SQL blocks (`{{if}}`, `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`) and dynamic iteration (`{{for}}`).

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers
Creates typed field helpers from your GORM models, usable for predicates and updates.

```go
// Example Model
type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
  Age  int
}

// Using Generated Field Helpers
generated.User.Name.Like("%jinzhu%") // WHERE name LIKE '%jinzhu%'
```

- Covers basic fields, nullable types, and arrays.
- Typed helper methods for common predicates (Equals, Between, IsNull) and setters.

### 3. Association Operations with Compile-Time Safety
Work effortlessly with related entities using generated helpers:

- **Create:** Insert and link related records in one operation.
- **Update:** Modify associated rows based on conditions.
- **Unlink:** Remove foreign key relations without deleting data.
- **Delete:** Remove associated data safely.
- **CreateInBatch:** Batch-create multiple related records.

### 4. Configurable Code Generation
Define package-level configuration with `genconfig.Config` to customize:

- Output directories
- Inclusion/exclusion filters for interfaces and structs
- Field mappings, including custom JSON or time types
- File-level or package-wide generation

### 5. Seamless Integration with GORM
Generated code returns and accepts familiar GORM components (`*gorm.DB`, context, clauses). This allows smooth incorporation into existing GORM-based projects.

## Why Should You Care?

### Revolutionize Your Database Code Quality

By leveraging GORM CLI, you reduce bugs caused by typo-prone string SQL, avoid runtime failures with mismatched types, and improve readability by using expressive generated methods tailored to your domain.

### Real-World Scenarios

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly scaffold queries based on your Go interfaces.
- **Large Projects:** Maintain consistency and correctness across complex models with associations.
- **Team Collaboration:** Clear and consistent APIs reduce onboarding time and improve code reviews.

### Before and After GORM CLI

| Without GORM CLI                            | With GORM CLI                      |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Hand-write SQL strings in queries          | Use generated type-safe methods   |
| Risky manual query parameter binding       | Compile-time checked SQL params   |
| Verbose and repetitive CRUD operations      | Fluent field helpers and association methods |

### Measurable Benefits
- Significant reduction in boilerplate code
- Compile-time verification eliminates a class of runtime errors
- Enhanced discoverability and developer productivity

## Getting Started Preview

### Quickstart Overview
1. Define your SQL queries inside Go interfaces with annotated comments containing SQL templates.
2. Define your GORM models in the same package or directory.
3. Run the CLI command to generate code:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path-to-your-code -o ./generated
```

4. Use the generated APIs in your application to perform database operations with confidence.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18 or higher (for generics support).
- GORM dependency installed.

### Next Steps
Start by exploring the [Quickstart & Basic Workflow](/overview/feature-overview-workflows/quickstart-workflow) to generate your first query APIs and field helpers. Learn about [Working with Associations](/guides/advanced-patterns/associations) and [Template-Driven Queries](/guides/advanced-patterns/template-dsl) for advanced use.

## Code Example: Defining Queries and Running Generation

```go
// Define query interface
 type Query[T any] interface {
   // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
   GetByID(id int) (T, error)

   // where("name=@name AND age=@age")
   FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)
 }

// Define your model
 type User struct {
   gorm.Model
   Name string
   Age  int
 }

// Generate code
$ gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated

// Use generated API
 u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```
