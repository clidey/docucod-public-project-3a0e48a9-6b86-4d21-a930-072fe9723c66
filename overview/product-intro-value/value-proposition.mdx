# Why Choose GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is engineered to elevate both business outcomes and engineering productivity by delivering a code generation solution tightly integrated with GORM, the leading Go ORM. This page illuminates the core values that set GORM CLI apart—compile-time safety, developer velocity, seamless integration, and maintainability. If you've faced errors from hand-written SQL or the unpredictability of reflection-based data access, GORM CLI offers a modern, type-safe alternative that minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency.

## Unlocking Compile-Time Safety for Database Access

Manual SQL queries and reflection often lead to subtle bugs, runtime errors, and hard-to-trace issues when working with databases in Go. GORM CLI eliminates these hazards by generating fully type-safe, fluent APIs directly from your Go code:

- **Type-Safe Query APIs:** Your database queries are compiled alongside your application, ensuring any mismatch or error is caught before runtime.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Strongly typed field helpers prevent invalid column references and provide autocompletion for safer, faster development.

This means every query you write with GORM CLI benefits from Go's powerful static typing, effectively preventing entire classes of runtime bugs.


## Accelerate Developer Productivity and Save Time

GORM CLI dramatically reduces the repetitive boilerplate code that developers typically write when interacting with databases:

- Write simple interface method signatures with intuitive SQL templates — no more hand-crafting hundreds of specific query functions.
- Generate idiomatic, maintainable Go code automatically, freeing you to focus on your business logic.
- Enjoy autocomplete, inline documentation, and consistent method signatures, making your developer experience smooth and error-free.

In real-world terms, this translates to significant time savings and faster iteration cycles across your data-driven applications.


## Seamless Integration With Your Existing GORM Projects

GORM CLI is built as a natural extension to the popular [GORM ORM](https://gorm.io/), ensuring that your existing projects and workflows remain uninterrupted:

- Generated code follows GORM idioms and patterns.
- Association helpers mimic GORM relationships (`has one`, `belongs to`, `many2many`) with compile-time validation.
- Works straightforwardly with your existing models and database schemas.

You retain all the power of GORM’s ecosystem while gaining safer, more expressive APIs generated directly from your interfaces and models.


## Easy Maintenance and Scalability of Your Data Layer

As your codebase and business requirements grow, maintaining hand-written SQL and reflection-heavy data layers becomes increasingly complex and error-prone. GORM CLI offers:

- **Configurable Generation:** Fine-tune generated output with `genconfig.Config` to include/exclude interfaces or structs, customize field mappings, and override output paths.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Your interface method signatures and models serve as the canonical specifications. Regenerate safely whenever your schema evolves.
- **Reduced Runtime Risks:** Eliminate reflection-induced performance overhead and hidden bugs.

This leads to a codebase that scales gracefully in both size and team velocity.

## Real-World Contrast: GORM CLI vs Hand-Written SQL or Reflection

| Aspect                  | Hand-Written SQL / Reflection                          | GORM CLI                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Type Safety**         | None; errors surface at runtime                        | Complete compile-time type validation      |
| **Boilerplate**         | High; repetitive and verbose code                      | Minimal; interfaces + templates generate APIs |
| **Maintainability**     | Difficult; SQL scattered and fragile                   | Structured; central interfaces and configs   |
| **Integration**         | Manual glue code with GORM or third-party layers      | Native seamless integration with GORM       |
| **Developer Velocity**  | Slower due to debugging and manual testing             | Faster due to autocompletion and error detection |

## Practical Examples of Time Savings

- Writing a new query method requires only a Go interface function and an accompanying SQL template comment.
- Complex conditional filtering with `{{where}}` and `{{if}}` directives automatically generate optimized code, no manual string construction.
- Batch association operations (`CreateInBatch`, `Unlink`, `Delete`) generated with type safety reduce error-prone manual relationship management.


---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Leverage Interface-Driven Queries:** Define full query logic in interface methods with SQL/templating comments. This centralizes query concerns.
- **Use Model Tags for Custom Behavior:** Employ `gen:"json"` or custom tags to map fields to specialized helpers.
- **Apply Generation Configurations:** Employ `genconfig.Config` to control output, inclusion, and field mappings for your projects.
- **Regenerate Continuously:** Run generation after schema or interface changes to catch issues early.
