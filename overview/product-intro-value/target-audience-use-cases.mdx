# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is designed to empower Go developers, database engineers, and teams seeking a streamlined, type-safe approach to database access within their GORM projects. This page outlines the ideal users and use cases for GORM CLI, clarifying where it delivers the most significant value and why adopting it will improve your development workflow and code quality.

## Who Is GORM CLI For?

### Go & GORM Developers Who Want Type Safety
If you write Go applications using GORM for database interactions, GORM CLI is built specifically for you. It automatically generates type-safe, fluent query APIs and model field helpers that eliminate common mistakes found in hand-written SQL or reflection-based code. This means fewer runtime errors, more predictable code behavior, and enhanced developer confidence.

### Teams Standardizing Safe, Maintainable Database Access
For teams working on large codebases, or those that emphasize high-quality, enforceable coding standards, GORM CLI provides a consistent, standardized way to generate database access layers. By adopting GORM CLI, team members share a common pattern that enhances collaboration and significantly reduces the risk of subtle bugs due to incorrect SQL or mismatched types.

### Projects Requiring Strongly Typed, Maintainable Data Layers
Complex applications with evolving schema or rigorous requirements for data integrity benefit immensely from GORM CLI’s compile-time guarantees. Whether you’re doing rapid prototyping or managing a large, enterprise-grade product, GORM CLI keeps your queries type-safe and expressive, improving long-term maintainability.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Rapid Prototyping and Iterative Development:** Quickly define interfaces with embedded SQL templates and generate production-ready query APIs without manual boilerplate coding.

- **Large Team Environments:** GORM CLI enforces consistent access patterns, making onboarding faster, reducing merge conflicts, and enabling scalable collaboration.

- **Complex Associations and Relationships:** Easily manage has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many relationships with generated helpers that provide safe, clear operations on associations.

- **Projects Needing Robust Compilation Checks:** Avoid errors early by leveraging compile-time safety for database interactions instead of relying on runtime validations.

- **Custom SQL Queries Within a Type-Safe Framework:** Use interface-driven SQL templates to embed dynamic and conditional queries, all while retaining strong typing and discoverability.

---

## Why This Matters to You

Before GORM CLI, developers often grappled with:

- Writing repetitive, error-prone SQL and ORM code by hand.
- Debugging runtime errors caused by subtle type mismatches or incorrect queries.
- Inconsistent coding styles across a team, increasing maintenance overhead.

With GORM CLI, you benefit from:

- **Compile-time validation:** Catch mistakes before your application runs.
- **Fluent, discoverable APIs:** Intuitive method names and type-safe parameters reduce cognitive load.
- **Reduced boilerplate:** Automatically generated code handles the repetitive tasks for you.
- **Seamless integration with GORM:** Stay within the familiar GORM ecosystem.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're part of a mid-sized development team building a complex business application. Your database schema involves multiple relationships — users, accounts, pets, languages, companies, and more. Manual query writing of such complexity becomes unwieldy, leading to bugs and inconsistent interfaces.

By adopting GORM CLI, you unify your team’s codebase around generated query interfaces and strongly-typed field helpers. Instead of manually constructing SQL queries or relying on reflection, your developers write clean Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates. The CLI tool then creates robust, type-safe APIs your entire team can use reliably, accelerating development and dramatically reducing errors.

## Practical Benefits at a Glance

- **Developer Productivity:** Accelerates coding by auto-generating ready-to-use query and update methods.
- **Safety and Reliability:** Improves code safety with compile-time guarantees.
- **Consistency:** Enforces a uniform pattern for database queries and updates across projects.
- **Scalability:** Supports complex model associations with generated helpers making relational data management straightforward.
- **Flexibility:** Allows custom SQL templating while preserving type safety and code clarity.

## Getting Started With GORM CLI

If you're ready to explore how GORM CLI can fit into your project, start with:

1. **Installing GORM CLI:** Ensure you have Go 1.18+ and install via `go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest`.

2. **Writing Interfaces and Models:** Define query interfaces with SQL templates that reflect your data access needs alongside your GORM models.

3. **Generating Code:** Run the CLI generation command (e.g., `gorm gen -i ./yourpkg -o ./generated`) to produce type-safe APIs.

4. **Using the Generated APIs:** Integrate generated code into your application for safer, simpler database operations.

<Tip>
Use GORM CLI when your project needs safer database code that scales with your application's complexity and team size. It’s particularly powerful when your data models include multiple associations and when you want to enforce type correctness at compile time.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If your project involves dynamic, unstructured SQL or requires complex query migrations frequently adjusted outside Go code, ensure your workflow accommodates regenerating code after schema or interface changes.
</Warning>
