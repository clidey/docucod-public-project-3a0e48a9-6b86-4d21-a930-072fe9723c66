# What is GORM CLI?

## Empowering GORM Developers with Type-Safe, Fluent Code Generation

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed specifically for Go developers using the GORM ORM. It bridges your static Go interfaces and SQL templates with your model definitions to generate type-safe, fluent APIs and field helpers that elevate how you build, query, and manage database interactions.

### The Problem It Solves

Writing data access layers often means manually crafting SQL queries or relying on reflection-based helpers that lack compile-time safety. This leads to runtime errors, clumsy APIs, and reduced developer productivity. GORM CLI removes this friction by transforming your interface-driven SQL comments and your Go structs into concrete, strongly typed query and update code.

---

## Why GORM CLI Matters to You

- **Type Safety Without Compromise:** Automatically generated code ensures your queries align with your model types. Say goodbye to silent bugs caused by mismatched parameters or return values.

- **Fluent, Discoverable APIs:** The generated interfaces and field helpers provide method chaining and predicate builders, empowering you to craft queries and updates confidently and intuitively.

- **Seamless Integration:** Designed as a companion to `gorm.io/gorm`, GORM CLI slots directly into your existing projects without disrupting your workflow.

- **Save Time, Reduce Boilerplate:** Write minimal SQL templates as Go interface comments, declare your models, and generate robust query APIs — skipping tedious manual boilerplate coding.

---

## What Exactly Is GORM CLI?

At its core, GORM CLI is a CLI tool and Go code generator that:

- Parses Go interface files enriched with SQL templates in method comments.
- Processes your Go model structs to create field helper definitions for queries, updates, and associations.
- Outputs Go source files providing:
  - **Type-safe Query Interfaces:** Methods derived from your SQL-templated interfaces, with automatic context injection and fluent chaining.
  - **Field Helper Structs:** Strongly typed fields for filters, predicates, and update setters, supporting basic fields and complex relations.

This union lets you write clear, intention-revealing code while benefitting from compile-time verification.

## Unlocking Fluent, Strongly Typed APIs from Your Code

### How it Works

1. **Define Query Interfaces with SQL Templates:** Write interfaces where each method’s comment contains raw SQL combined with a simple templating DSL to express dynamic clauses (`{{where}}`, `{{set}}`, `{{if}}`, etc.).

2. **Declare Model Structs:** Use your existing Go structs representing your database tables, including conventional GORM tags.

3. **Run GORM CLI:** Point the CLI at your interfaces and models sources. It analyzes your code, applies any generation configuration, and produces new files containing:
   - Concrete implementations of your queries
   - Typed fields for all model columns
   - Association helpers for managing relationships

4. **Use the Generated Code:** Import the generated package to get compile-time verified, expressively typed APIs to execute queries and perform CRUD operations.

### A Real-World Example

Consider a user management system:

```go
// Query Interface with SQL template
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Typed Model Struct
type User struct {
  ID        uint
  Name      string
  Age       int
  CreatedAt time.Time
}
```

After running GORM CLI, you get:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)               // Type-safe query
filteredUsers := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)  // Fluent filtering
```

## Key Benefits and Use Cases

- **Eliminate Stringly-Typed Queries:** Your queries are generated from interface methods with embedded SQL, eliminating manual string concatenation or error-prone query building.

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Incorrect parameter types or missing context parameters are caught during compilation.

- **Simplify Managing Complex Queries:** The embedded templating DSL supports dynamic where clauses, conditional updates, and iteration over collections, making complex queries manageable.

- **Accelerate Development:** Rapidly scaffold new query interfaces and model helpers, reducing repetitive coding.

- **Maintainable Codebase:** Separation of concerns keeps your business logic clear, while generated code focuses on data access.

- **Advanced Association Handling:** Helpers for associations allow create/update/unlink/delete operations with type safety and minimal bookkeeping.

## Getting Started Preview

1. **Install GORM CLI**

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

2. **Write SQL-Templated Go Interfaces & Models**

Create interface files with SQL in comments and model structs in the same or neighboring packages.

3. **Run the Generator**

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/your/interfaces -o ./generated
```

4. **Use Generated APIs**

Import and call the generated methods, enjoy code completion and compile-time checks.

## Tips for Success

- Use the `genconfig.Config` struct to customize generation paths, map custom types, and include/exclude specific interfaces or structs.
- Leverage the embedded SQL template DSL for concise, reusable query patterns supporting conditionals and iteration.
- Combine generated field helpers with GORM’s standard APIs for seamless query building.

## Common Pitfalls

- Failing to annotate interfaces with precise SQL templates may result in incomplete code generation.
- Not including `ctx context.Context` in interfaces is handled automatically, but be mindful when writing custom methods.
- Configuration mismatches between your model and generation config can lead to unexpected output – use exclusion/inclusion filters carefully.

## Summary

GORM CLI is the definitive code generator for Go projects using GORM, combining interface-driven SQL templates and model introspection to produce type-safe, fluent APIs that transform your data access workflows. It frees you from boilerplate, improves code correctness, and enhances developer experience across all query and association scenarios.
