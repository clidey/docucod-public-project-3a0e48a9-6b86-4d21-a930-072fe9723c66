# Product Value & Use Cases

Unlock the full potential of your Go backend development with GORM CLI — a powerful tool that brings type safety, automation, and productivity gains to your data access layers. This page highlights the tangible business benefits you gain from adopting GORM CLI, clarifies who will find the most value, and showcases real-world scenarios where this solution transforms how you interact with SQL databases through GORM.

## Why GORM CLI Matters to You

Imagine building robust, maintainable Go applications without the repetitive and error-prone task of hand-crafting SQL queries and filters. GORM CLI eliminates these obstacles by generating fluent, type-safe query APIs and streamlined field helpers directly from your Go interfaces and models. This means fewer bugs, faster development cycles, and code that is both more readable and easier to evolve.

---

## Who Benefits Most?

- **Go Backend Developers:** Crafting data access layers with GORM for SQL databases, looking to reduce boilerplate and increase confidence.
- **Teams Building Scalable Applications:** Needing consistent, maintainable query APIs that reflect evolving database schemas.
- **Projects Leveraging Complex Associations:** Working with relationships like has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many, who want safe and fluent association operations.

---

## Core Business Benefits Explained

### 1. **Strong Type Safety for Reliable Code**
- Avoid runtime errors caused by misspelled columns or mismatched types.
- Leverage compile-time checks thanks to model-driven, strongly typed field helpers.
- Example: Instead of writing raw SQL conditions "age > 18", use `generated.User.Age.Gt(18)` with autocompletion and validation.

### 2. **Dramatic Reduction of Boilerplate Code**
- Automatically generate repetitive query methods from Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates.
- Eliminate manual construction of SQL strings for filters, updates, and joins.
- Example: Write an interface method `GetByID(id int) (User, error)` with a SQL comment, and GORM CLI generates the implementation.

### 3. **Improved Developer Productivity and Code Clarity**
- Fluent APIs that mirror your database schema and embedded SQL logic.
- Intuitive helpers for predicates (Equals, GreaterThan, Null checks), setters, and expressions.
- Streamlined association handling for creating, updating, unlinking, and deleting related records.

### 4. **Seamless Integration with GORM and Existing Workflows**
- Generated code builds on top of `gorm.io/gorm`, requiring minimal disruption.
- Support for native GORM features and idiomatic Go coding patterns.

## Typical Use Cases

### Building a Type-Safe Data Access Layer
Define query interfaces with embedded SQL templates for your entities and generate the concrete APIs. Gain strong typing and discoverable methods for all your CRUD operations.

### Reducing Error-Prone, Hand-Coded Queries
Forget manual query construction prone to typos, SQL injection risks, and complex error handling. Use the generated field helpers to express conditions safely, e.g., `generated.User.Name.Like("%alice%")`.

### Leveraging Model Associations in Applications
Work easily with relationships without writing complicated joins. For example, create a user and their pets in one operation using association helpers like `generated.User.Pets.Create(...)` combined with `Set()`.

### Streamlining Updates and Batch Operations
Perform bulk updates with clear, concise API calls. Update multiple fields, set zero or null values safely, and increment fields effortlessly using expressive `Set()` helpers.

## Before and After: The Transformation

| Without GORM CLI                                 | With GORM CLI                                   |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Manually assemble SQL strings with error risks | Write Go interfaces with SQL templates, then generate type-safe APIs |
| Hand-code filters and Where clauses repeatedly | Use generated helpers like `User.Age.Gt(18)` that are auto-completed and checked |
| Manage associations with custom code and joins | Fluent association management (`Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, `Delete`) with compile-time safety |

---

## Return on Investment (ROI)

- **Save Development Time:** Cut down hours of manual query writing and debugging.
- **Reduce Bugs:** Eliminate a large class of SQL injection and runtime query errors with safe code generation.
- **Accelerate Onboarding:** New team members ramp up faster when code clearly maps to database models and relationships.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always generate code after updating your models or query interfaces to keep helpers in sync.
- Use Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates to keep your data access layer clean and declarative.
- Organize your models to maximize association helper generation and simplify relationship operations.

## Quick Preview: How You’ll Use Generated Code

Here’s what a typical user workflow looks like with the generated APIs:

```go
// Find users over 18 who are active
users, err := gorm.G[models.User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18), generated.User.Role.Eq("active")).
    Find(ctx)

// Update a user’s role safely
_, err = gorm.G[models.User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")).
    Update(ctx, "role", "admin")

// Create a new user and associate a pet
err = gorm.G[models.User](db).
    Set(
        generated.User.Name.Set("Bob"),
        generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("Fido")),
    ).
    Create(ctx)
```

Each API uses strong typing and automatically binds parameters safely and efficiently.

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **Outdated Generated Code:** Always run generation after model or interface changes.
- **Missing Context Parameter:** Generated methods insert `context.Context` if missing; ensure you pass a valid context.
- **Zero Values in Updates:** Use provided setters explicitly to assign zero or NULL values safely.
