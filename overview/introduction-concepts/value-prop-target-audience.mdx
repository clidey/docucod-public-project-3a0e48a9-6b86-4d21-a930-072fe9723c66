# Value Proposition & Target Audience

## Unlock Safer, Faster, and More Maintainable GORM Database Code

GORM CLI transforms your database interactions by generating **type-safe**, **interface-driven query APIs** and **model-driven field helpers** that integrate seamlessly with GORM. This tooling empowers Go developers to eliminate boilerplate, catch errors at compile time, and write clearer, more maintainable code that precisely expresses your data access intentions.

### Why GORM CLI Matters to You

Imagine building database queries and updates that are:

- **Fully type-checked by the Go compiler** — preventing runtime bugs caused by typo-ed columns or mismatched types.
- **Discoverable and fluent** — with generated helpers and method signatures guiding you through available fields and associations.
- **Flexible and expressive** — supporting complex, custom SQL queries with safe binding through interface-driven templates.
- **Automatically generated and synchronized** — your queries always reflect the current state of your Go models, preventing divergence.

This leads to more reliable, efficient development cycles, and a codebase that scales gracefully without growing technical debt.

## Who Benefits Most from GORM CLI

This tool is designed for Go developers who:

- Use GORM extensively and want to leverage **compile-time safety** for CRUD operations.
- Build applications that require **rapid API prototyping**, where query interfaces evolve frequently.
- Maintain **complex domain models** with rich associations needing safe, concise manipulation.
- Desire **streamlined workflows** that remove repetitive SQL boilerplate in favor of generated, readable code.

Whether you work on microservices, web backends, or any data-centric Go project, GORM CLI empowers you to focus on business logic instead of manual query construction.

---

## Classic Use Cases

### 1. Rapid API Development with Type-Safe Queries
Developers can declare simple Go interfaces with SQL templates in comments and get concrete implementations that:

- Return specific model types with full type safety
- Bind SQL parameters automatically
- Support complex conditional queries through an intuitive templating DSL

This accelerates delivering new features while ensuring reliability.

### 2. Eliminating Boilerplate in CRUD Operations
By generating model-driven field helpers, GORM CLI allows you to:

- Easily construct filter expressions and update sets using generated fields
- Manage associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many2many) with semantic helper methods
- Write concise, readable code for create, update, unlink, and delete scenarios

This removes error-prone manual query writing and accelerates maintenance.

### 3. Ensuring Query Safety Across Large Teams
With generated query APIs:

- Teams avoid errors from string-based queries
- Code reviews become easier as generated code clarifies intent
- Refactoring models automatically refreshes corresponding query helpers

This leads to improved collaboration and code quality.

## Benefits at a Glance

- **Compile-time safety:** Eliminate runtime SQL errors due to typos or type mismatches.
- **Fluent, discoverable API:** Autocompletion-friendly helpers make queries easier and less error-prone.
- **Model-driven:** Field helpers always mirror your Go structs and associations.
- **Customizable generation:** Config options let you include/exclude types or adapt generation.
- **Seamless GORM integration:** Use alongside standard GORM calls without friction.

## Practical Example to Illustrate Value

```go
// Define interface with SQL templates
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Generated use:
v, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Model-driven filtering:
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
```

Here, the interface method GetByID is automatically implemented with type safety and SQL binding. The generated `User` helper fields enable expressive, fluent filters like `Age.Gt(18)` avoiding manual SQL strings.

---

## Summary

GORM CLI is for Go developers seeking to elevate their use of GORM through generated, type-safe query APIs and field helpers. It dramatically reduces boilerplate, improves query safety, and provides fluent abstractions for model fields and associations, enabling faster, more reliable development.
