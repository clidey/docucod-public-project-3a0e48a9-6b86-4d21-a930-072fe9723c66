# Feature Quick Overview

GORM CLI empowers Go developers working with GORM to generate type-safe, fluent query APIs and model-driven field helpers, dramatically enhancing your database interaction experience. This page presents a concise, at-a-glance summary of the core capabilities, from how the generator operates to the seamless integration with standard GORM APIs. Use this overview as a navigation beacon to dive deeper into specific features and workflows.

---

## What You Will Discover Here
- How GORM CLI transforms your interface definitions and models into robust query APIs
- Key features like interface-driven queries, field helpers, association management, and configurability
- Integration points with standard `gorm.io/gorm` APIs ensuring smooth adoption
- The practical workflow from raw SQL annotated interfaces and model structs to ready-to-use, safe Go code

---

## Generator Workflow at a Glance

At the heart of GORM CLI lies a straightforward generation pipeline that extracts metadata and SQL templates from your Go interfaces and model structs to produce tailored code for your project.

1. **Interface Parsing & Annotation**
   - Write Go interfaces with method comments containing SQL templates.
   - Methods map parameters to SQL placeholders enabling compile-time safety.

2. **Model Struct Analysis**
   - Process model structs to generate strong field helpers.
   - Includes support for basic fields (strings, ints, bools, time) and associations.

3. **Code Generation & Output**
   - The CLI tool processes specified input paths.
   - Generates Go code for interface-driven query implementations and field helper structs.
   - Applies configuration overrides if present.

4. **Integration with GORM**
   - Generated code returns or extends `gorm.Interface` allowing fluent chaining with GORM's standard API.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### Interface-Driven, Type-Safe Query APIs
- **Strongly Typed Methods:** Write query methods with annotated SQL, including dynamic placeholders and conditions.
- **Compile-Time Safety:** Method signatures and parameters are validated at compile time.
- **Automatic Context Injection:** If context is omitted, it's added automatically for safe concurrency.

### Model-Driven Field Helpers
- **Typed Predicates & Setters:** Generate helpers for filtering, ordering, and updating based on model fields.
- **Support for Basic Field Types:** Includes int, float, string, bool, time.Time, []byte, and custom scanner/valuer types.
- **Flexible Field Mapping:** Use config to customize mapping for JSON fields or other special types.

### Association Helpers
- **Operations Covered:** Create, CreateInBatch, Update, Unlink, Delete for flagged model associations.
- **Association Semantics:** Properly support `belongs to`, `has one`, `has many`, and `many2many` relationships with defined side effects.
- **Conditional Association Updates:** Apply `Where` clauses to target subsets of association entries.

### Configurability & Customization
- **OutPath Control:** Output directory can be customized per package or globally.
- **Include/Exclude Filters:** Whitelist or blacklist interfaces and structs via patterns or type literals.
- **Field Type Remapping:** Override generated helpers using `genconfig.Config`.
- **File-Level or Package-Level Application:** Config can apply for entire packages or individual files.

## How Generated Code Fits Into Your Workflow

GORM CLI-generated code becomes a natural extension of your GORM workflow.

```go
// Use generated Query interface
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Fluent chaining with standard GORM API using field helpers
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)

// Association operations
err = gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This code is:
- **Strongly typed**, eliminating SQL string errors
- **Fluent and discoverable**, improving developer productivity
- **Safe**, preventing common runtime bugs with compile-time checks

## Practical Examples Illustrating Key Features

### Query API with SQL Templates

```go
// Interface method documentation contains raw SQL plus template directives
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)

// Using conditional WHERE clause
// {{where}}
//   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
// {{end}}
FilterUsers(user User) ([]T, error)
```

### Usage of Field Helpers

```go
// Predicate helpers
generated.User.ID.Eq(1)             // id = 1
generated.User.Name.Like("%jinzhu%")  // name LIKE '%jinzhu%'

// Setting values for updates and creates
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Age.Incr(1),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

### Association Handlers

```go
// Create related pet for new user
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)

// Unlink associated pets matching condition
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("old")).Unlink()).
  Update(ctx)
```

## Integration Points with Standard GORM

- Generated query interfaces return `gorm.Interface` types enabling seamless chaining.
- Field helpers utilize GORM clauses like `clause.Expr` under the hood.
- Association operations map cleanly to GORM's association semantics, extending your control with type safety.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin:
1. Define your query interfaces with SQL annotations alongside your model structs.
2. Run the CLI generator specifying your input Go files and output directory.
3. Import and use the generated code as part of your GORM-based data layer.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- Ensure SQL templates align with method parameters; the generator validates this.
- Use configuration overrides (`genconfig.Config`) to handle custom types or exclude legacy interfaces.
- Regularly validate generated code correctness during CI with `go test`.
- Leverage conditional template directives (`{{if}}`, `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`) to handle dynamic SQL safely.
