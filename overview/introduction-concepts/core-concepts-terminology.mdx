# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the core concepts and terminology of GORM CLI is essential for effective use and mastery of its interface-driven query APIs and model-driven field helpers. This page decodes the foundational terms and components you will encounter throughout this documentation and during your development workflows.

---

## Interface-Driven Query APIs

### What Are They?
Interface-driven query APIs are Go interfaces you write with embedded SQL templates in method comments. GORM CLI generates from these interfaces concrete, type-safe query implementations, allowing you to interact with your database using expressive, discoverable, and compile-time checked methods.

### Why It Matters
- **Type Safety**: Avoid runtime SQL errors by catching mistakes at compile time.
- **Readability**: Your data access code expresses intent clearly through method names and SQL fragments.
- **Maintainability**: Updating query logic only requires changes to your interface definitions.

### Key Terms
- **@param placeholders:** Bind Go method parameters to SQL query parameters seamlessly.
- **`@@table` placeholder:** Dynamically refers to the table name associated with the model.
- **SQL Template DSL:** Custom directives (`{{where}}`, `{{if}}`) control dynamic SQL generation based on input.

### Example
```go
// Query interface with SQL template
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE @@column=@value
  FilterWithColumn(column string, value string) (T, error)
}
```

In this example, the CLI generates a type-safe implementation with methods like `GetByID` returning the matched record or an error.

## Model-Driven Field Helpers

### What Are They?
Model-driven field helpers are generated Go variables representing fields inside your model structs. They provide strongly typed helpers to build filters, updates, comparisons, and association operations fluent in code.

### Why It Matters
- **Expressive Query Building:** You write concise and readable filter conditions like `generated.User.Age.Gt(18)`.
- **Avoid Magic Strings:** Reference columns and fields with compile-time safety.
- **Handle Nullables & Custom Types:** Field helpers support types such as `sql.NullTime` transparently.

### Predicates & Setters
- **Predicates:** Methods such as `.Eq(value)` or `.Between(min, max)` produce SQL conditions.
- **Setters:** Methods such as `.Set(value)` or `.Incr(1)` help create update expressions.

### Handling Associations
Helpers representing relations (has one, has many, belongs to, many-to-many) allow you to perform safe association operations:
- Create, update, unlink, and delete related records in an idiomatic way.

### Example
```go
// Using predicates
generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")             // name = 'alice'
generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)            // age BETWEEN 18 AND 65

// Updating with setters
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("jinzhu"),
    generated.User.Age.Incr(1),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

---

## Associations and Their Semantics

Understanding how associations operate in generated helpers is key:
- **Belongs To:** Unlink clears the foreign key on the child.
- **Has One / Has Many:** Unlink clears foreign keys on associated records.
- **Many-to-Many:** Unlink/Delete operations remove join table rows without deleting parent or child.

Operations are composed into fluent calls:
- `.Create()` inserts new related rows linking them to the parent.
- `.Update()` modifies matched associated rows.
- `.Unlink()` removes the association without deleting data.
- `.Delete()` removes associated data (or join rows for many2many).

Example:
```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Unlink()).
  Update(ctx)
```

## SQL Template DSL

GORM CLI uses a domain-specific language inside interface method comments to declare SQL templates with dynamic clauses and parameters. Key directives include:

| Directive   | Purpose                         | Example Fragment                                            |
|-------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@@table`   | Inserts modelâ€™s table name       | `SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id`                        |
| `@@column`  | Dynamic column binding           | `WHERE @@column=@value`                                     |
| `@param`    | Bind Go param to SQL param       | `WHERE status=@status`                                      |
| `{{where}}` | Wraps optional WHERE predicates  | `{{where}} age>18 {{end}}`                                  |
| `{{set}}`   | Wraps conditional SET clauses    | `{{set}} name=@name {{end}}`                                |
| `{{if}}`    | Conditional SQL fragments        | `{{if age > 0}} AND age=@age {{end}}`                       |
| `{{for}}`   | Loop over collections            | `{{for _, tag := range tags}} tags LIKE concat('%',@tag,'%') OR {{end}}` |

This DSL empowers expressive, conditionally dynamic queries in a single interface method comment.

### Practical Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM @@table
{{where}}
  {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
  {{if user.Age > 0}} AND age=@user.Age {{end}}
{{end}}
```

## How This Fits In Your Workflow

By mastering these core concepts, you gain the ability to:

1. Write declarative Go interfaces that represent your database queries.
2. Define models that automatically produce typed field helpers.
3. Combine both generated query APIs and field helpers for a fluent, safe, and maintainable data access layer.
4. Use association helpers to manage linked data without error-prone manual SQL.
5. Leverage the SQL template DSL to control complex dynamic queries with clarity and flexibility.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **SQL doesn't update according to parameters?** Ensure your SQL template uses `{{where}}` or `{{if}}` directives correctly.
- **Generated code missing methods?** Confirm your interface method comments have proper SQL template directives.
- **Field helpers unavailable for a model field?** Check `genconfig.Config` mappings and field tags for custom helper assignments.
