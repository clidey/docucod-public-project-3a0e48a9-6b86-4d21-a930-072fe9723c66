# Feature-to-File Reference Map

For advanced users and contributors, this page delivers a precise mapping between the core features of GORM CLI and their primary implementation or example files. This reference accelerates deep technical exploration, onboarding, and contributes to a clearer understanding of where to find key code generation capabilities within the codebase.

---

## Why This Map Matters

Navigating a code generator as rich as GORM CLI can be daunting. This map acts like a compass to:  
- Quickly locate how major features are implemented  
- Understand where to find example usage and tests  
- Enable informed contributions and customizations  

Whether you're exploring the internals or debugging, these pointers will save time and focus your investigation.

## Major Feature to Core File Reference

| Feature                          | Primary File(s) & Location                          | Description & Usage |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Query Interfaces Generation** | `internal/gen/generator.go`                        | Core generator logic parses interfaces and SQL templates, building type-safe methods from SQL annotations.
|                                 | `internal/gen/generator_test.go`                   | Unit tests verifying interface parsing and generator correctness.
|                                 | `examples/query.go`                                | Real-world example of query interfaces with templated SQL.

| **Model Struct Parsing & Field Helpers**  | `internal/gen/generator.go`                        | Processes Go struct types, extracts fields, and maps types to field helpers.
|                                 | `examples/models/user.go`                          | Example model definitions showcasing associations and field tag usage.

| **Code Generation Template**    | `internal/gen/template.go`                         | The core Go template producing generated code files, including interface impls, struct-based field helpers, and imports.

| **Configuration & Filtering**   | `genconfig/config.go`                              | Defines per-package generation configuration: output paths, field mappings, included/excluded types.
|                                 | `internal/gen/generator.go`                        | Applies config during file processing to filter interfaces and structs.
|                                 | `examples/filters/pattern/config.go`               | Example config file demonstrating interface inclusion filters.

| **SQL Template DSL Parsing**    | `internal/gen/utils.go`                            | Contains logic to extract SQL fragments from comments and process DSL directives.

| **Association & Field Type Detection** | `internal/gen/generator.go`                        | Differentiates basic fields, struct associations, and slice relations for correct field helper generation.


## Example Real-World Usage Files

- **Example Models**: `examples/models/user.go` contains a complex data model with typical associations (has one, has many, many to many) tailored for code generation.
- **Query Interfaces Examples**: `examples/query.go` shows SQL templated interfaces supporting complex queries with conditionals, iteration, and update sets.

## Key Concepts From This Map

- Interfaces annotated with SQL comments are processed to create fluent, type-safe query APIs.
- Models are parsed to generate field helpers for all column types and associations, enabling expressive filters, setters, and relation operations.
- The generation template file stitches the parsed data into syntactically correct Go code.
- Configurations enable fine control over what is generated, supporting incremental adoption and customization.

## Tips for Contributors and Deep Users

- Focus on `internal/gen/generator.go` to understand core logic for AST parsing and filtering.
- Inspect `internal/gen/template.go` to customize or extend the code generation format.
- Use the example files under `examples/` to test changes or validate generated outputs.
- Extend `genconfig.Config` usage for custom field mappings or interface selections.


---

## Troubleshooting & Next Steps

If you encounter issues during generation or want to customize outputs, consider the following:  
- Review interface filtering rules in `genconfig.Config`.  
- Use verbose logging or debug by stepping through `Process` and `Gen` methods in `Generator`.  
- Explore related docs for config and template syntax: [Customizing Code Generation](https://docs.example.com/guides/advanced-usage/customizing-generation).  

Use this map as your reference to jump into specific feature areas effectively.
