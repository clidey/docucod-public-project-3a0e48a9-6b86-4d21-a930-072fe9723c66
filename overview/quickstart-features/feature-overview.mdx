# Key Features at a Glance

Unlock the full power of your GORM projects with GORM CLIâ€™s streamlined, type-safe code generation.

## Empower Your Workflow with Type-Safe Query APIs

- **Interface-Driven Queries:** Write Go interfaces decorated with SQL templates in method comments, and GORM CLI generates concrete, type-safe query APIs for those interfaces automatically.
- **Compile-Time Safety:** Prevents common runtime SQL errors by enforcing type correctness and parameter binding at compile time.
- **Fluent Query Building:** Generated APIs enable intuitive, discoverable, and strongly typed methods that make querying easier and less error-prone.

## Model-Driven Field Helpers for Robust Data Manipulation

- **Strongly Typed Helpers:** Generate helper fields for primitives (ints, strings, bools, times, etc.) and complex types, providing predicates for filters, updates, and ordering.
- **Association Operations:** Seamlessly operate on related data with built-in support for `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, `Delete`, and batch operations on associations such as has-one, has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many.
- **Custom Field Support:** Extend your models with custom field helpers, including JSON columns and specialized mappings, to handle database-specific behavior elegantly.

## Seamless Integration with GORM

- Generated code integrates directly into your existing GORM workflow using familiar conventions.
- Enables type-safe creation, update, and query operations without disrupting your current database setup.
- Supports context-aware database calls for performance and control.

## Flexible Configuration for Tailored Generation

- Fine-tune what and how code is generated using `genconfig.Config`.
- Control file output paths, included or excluded model structs and interfaces, field type mapping, and custom helper integration.
- Support for file-level or package-level configuration allows granular control for large or multi-module projects.

## Template-Based SQL Queries with Advanced DSL

- Use a powerful SQL template DSL in interface method comments to produce dynamic SQL:
  - `@@table` and `@@column` placeholders for dynamic model/table resolution.
  - `@param` bindings safely connect Go method parameters to SQL statements.
  - Conditional directives (`{{if}}`, `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`) for complex query construction.
  - Support for loops (`{{for}}`) and expressions to handle collections and conditional SQL generation.
- Example snippet:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)

// UPDATE @@table
// {{set}}
//   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name, {{end}}
//   {{if user.Age > 0}} age=@user.Age, {{end}}
// {{end}}
// WHERE id=@id
UpdateInfo(user User, id int) error
```

## Real-World Examples

- **Type-Safe Query:**

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

- **Filter and Update With Field Helpers:**

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")).
  Set(
    generated.User.Age.Incr(1),
    generated.User.IsAdult.Set(true),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

- **Manage Associations:**

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

### Tips for Success

- Define your interfaces with clear SQL templates to leverage powerful compile-time checking.
- Use the flexible configuration to include only relevant models and interfaces, optimizing generation time.
- Leverage association helpers to safely and effectively manage relational data without manual joins.
- Extend field helpers with your own custom types as needed for your domain.

### Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Code Generation and Queries">
<Accordion title="SQL Template Syntax Errors">
Check for correct use of placeholders like `@@table` and parameter bindings like `@param`. Missing or misspelled tokens will lead to generation failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect Method Signatures">
Ensure your interface method parameters and return types are consistent and supported by the generator to avoid runtime type mismatches.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Association Operation Mistakes">
Remember the semantics of `Unlink` vs. `Delete` on associations to avoid unintended data loss. Use conditions with `Where` carefully.
