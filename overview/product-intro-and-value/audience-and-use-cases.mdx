# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Is GORM CLI For?

GORM CLI is tailored for Go developers and teams leveraging the power of GORM for their data persistence layer. It especially benefits:

- **Individual Go developers** seeking safer and more expressive data access patterns.
- **Development teams** aiming for consistency and type safety across their codebases.
- **Project leads** who want to accelerate onboarding by generating clear, maintainable query APIs and documented field helpers.

If youâ€™re building applications or services in Go that use GORM for ORM, GORM CLI provides you with generation tools that translate your models and query interfaces into fluent, compile-time safe code.

## Typical Scenarios & Use Cases

### 1. New Greenfield API Projects

Starting a new API backend with fresh domain models? GORM CLI enables you to:

- Define clean Go interface methods for your queries with embedded SQL templates.
- Automatically generate strongly typed, easy-to-navigate query APIs.
- Get model-driven field helpers that simplify building filters, updates, and association operations.

**Outcome:** Your data access layer is ready from day one, reducing runtime errors and code duplication.

### 2. Existing Projects Seeking Type- and Query-Safety

If you have legacy or growing projects where 
- Query correctness is hard to enforce,
- Maintaining SQL strings as inline code leads to bugs,
- The team is looking for compile-time guarantees,

GORM CLI helps by generating interface-driven query APIs ensuring type-safety and consistent parameter binding.

This means fewer runtime failures related to invalid queries and easier refactoring.

### 3. Teams Needing Easier Onboarding & Clearer APIs

Large codebases can confuse new developers when query logic is scattered and undocumented.

With GORM CLI, generated code is:

- Discoverable and fluent,
- Accompanied by field helpers that clearly reflect your data model,
- Structured so queries are intuitive and less error-prone.

**Benefit:** New team members ramp up faster, confidently write queries, and maintain consistency.

### 4. Complex Association Handling

If your application relies heavily on associations (belongs to, has many, many-to-many), GORM CLI generates comprehensive helpers for:

- Creating and linking related records in batch or individually,
- Updating and unlinking associations safely,
- Deleting association rows with filtered controls.

Your code stays cleaner while interactions with complex relations remain type-safe and easy to maintain.

## Real-World Example Flow

Imagine a team building an employee management system:

1. They define employee and department models.
2. Create Go interfaces for queries like fetching employees by ID, filtering by multiple fields, or updating details.
3. Run the GORM CLI generator to produce type-safe API methods and field helpers.
4. Use generated APIs to perform database operations confidently.
5. As the system grows, maintainability improves, onboarding becomes faster, and bugs in queries decrease significantly.
