# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe, Fluent, and Discoverable APIs for Your Go Database Projects

GORM CLI automates the generation of robust, type-safe query APIs and model-driven helpers built directly from your Go database models and raw SQL interface definitions. Instead of manually writing repetitive database access code, GORM CLI produces fluent, discoverable, and compile-time safe APIs tailored for GORM projects, letting you focus entirely on your application's business logic.

---

### What Is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a command-line tool that generates Go code for GORM-based projects by analyzing Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates and your model structs. It creates:

- **Interface-driven, type-safe query APIs**: Generate concrete methods from your Go interface definitions that include SQL query templates. These methods enforce type safety, reduce runtime errors, and provide a fluent API for querying.

- **Model-driven field helpers**: From your GORM model structs, generate field and association helpers to simplify building filters, updates, and association operations with compile-time correctness.

Together, these generated components streamline database interactions by transforming your data models and query intentions into discoverable Go code designed to catch errors early and speed up development.

---

### The Core Purpose

Manual SQL queries and reflection-heavy dynamic code can lead to bugs, cumbersome code navigation, and poor developer productivity. GORM CLI solves these problems by automating:

- The creation of strongly typed query functions derived from raw SQL annotations in Go interfaces.
- Generating easily navigable field helpers for models, including advanced support for associations like has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many.

This automation dramatically cuts down boilerplate code, improves code safety, and results in intuitive, chainable APIs that reflect your database schema directly in Go.

---

### What Makes GORM CLI Different?

Unlike generic code generators or ORM tools, GORM CLI focuses strictly on **type safety** and **developer ergonomics** by:

- Using Go generics to produce fluent APIs that work seamlessly with your GORM `*gorm.DB` instances.
- Leveraging Go's AST parsing to interpret your code and SQL templates, ensuring your interfaces and model structs drive the generated code without guesswork.
- Allowing powerful SQL template DSL for conditional where/set clauses, dynamic columns, and iteration, put directly in method comments.
- Offering customizable generation through package-level configurations, enabling overrides for output paths, field mappings, and inclusion/exclusion rules.

The result is a fast, reliable code generation process that creates fully typed, idiomatic Go APIs that stay in sync with your data models.

---

### How It Works at a High Level

GORM CLI analyzes your project files, particularly Go interface definitions that contain SQL queries in comments and model structs with GORM tags.

- It parses the Go Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract interfaces, methods, parameters, result types, and SQL template comments.
- Uses template engines to generate Go source files, which implement your query interfaces with type-safe, context-aware methods.
- Generates model variables corresponding to your structs with field and association helpers to build expression predicates for queries and updates.

This generated code integrates naturally with `gorm.io/gorm` enabling easy, type-safe database operations.

### Real User Scenario

Imagine you're developing a Go backend for a user management system. You define a `Query[T any]` interface where you write SQL templates in comments for common queries like `GetByID` or `FilterByNameAndAge`. Instead of manually writing repetitive query functions with error-prone string concatenation or reflection, you run the GORM CLI generator:

```
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

The tool creates a `QueryImpl` struct with methods like `GetByID(ctx, id int) (User, error)` which you use directly in your app. At the same time, it generates `User` field helpers:

```go
generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")
generated.User.Age.Between(18, 30)
```

This lets you build expressive, compile-time checked queries without manual SQL string construction, preventing bugs and accelerating development.

---

### Practical Tips

- **Always annotate your interfaces with clear SQL templates in comments.** Use the GORM CLI template DSL (`@@table`, `@param`, `{{where}}`, `{{set}}`) to handle dynamic conditions.
- **Maintain model struct tags accurately** to reflect your database schema; this improves the quality of generated field helpers.
- Use package-level `genconfig.Config` for fine-grained control over output paths and custom field mappings.
- Combine generated query APIs with GORM's existing features like transactions and hooks for powerful database operations.

---

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Go interfaces have proper return types; query methods returning data must end with an error return.
- Verify that SQL template placeholders match method parameters to avoid generation errors.
- When no code appears generated, check your package-level config for exclusion or inclusion patterns.
- Use verbose logging during generation to identify parsing or template errors.
