# Installation & Setup

Welcome to the gateway of your journey with GORM CLI. This page is your essential guide to preparing your environment, installing the tool, and verifying that everything is in place to begin leveraging GORM CLI's powerful code generation capabilities in your Go projects.

---

## Why This Matters

Getting started swiftly and correctly ensures you unlock the full productivity benefits of GORM CLI â€” generating type-safe, fluent query APIs and model field helpers without friction. Clear prerequisites and a smooth installation form the foundation for a frustration-free development experience.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you install GORM CLI, verify that your environment meets these critical requirements:

- **Go Version 1.18 or Higher**
  - GORM CLI relies on Go generics introduced in 1.18 for type-safe code generation.
- **Working Go Environment**
  - Your `$GOPATH` and Go modules support must be set up for installing and running Go tools.
- **Network Access**
  - To download GORM CLI from the public module repository.

Use this command to check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If your version is below 1.18, upgrade before proceeding.

---

## Installing GORM CLI

Run the official Go install command to fetch and install the latest GORM CLI binary:

```bash
go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

This places the `gorm` executable into your Go bin directory (usually `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`).

### Confirming Installation

After installation, verify the binary is accessible:

```bash
gorm --help
```

You should see command usage documentation, including the `gen` subcommand for code generation.

> ðŸš€ Tip: Add your Go bin directory to your system PATH if `gorm` is not found.

---

## Basic Setup Workflow

1. **Write Your Query Interface and Models**
   - Code your interfaces with embedded SQL templates and define your model structs in Go.

2. **Run the Generator**
   - Use the GORM CLI `gen` command to generate type-safe APIs.

3. **Use Generated Code in Your Application**
   - Consume the generated helpers and interfaces to write safe and maintainable database queries.

Example command to generate APIs:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./path/to/interfaces -o ./generated
```

This command takes your Go interface files as input and outputs generated code in the specified directory.

---

## Verifying a Successful Setup

To verify your GORM CLI installation and generation pipeline:

- Prepare a minimal interface file with SQL-annotated methods.
- Run the `gorm gen` command targeting this file.
- Inspect the output directory for newly generated Go source files.
- Try importing and calling a generated method in your test or main application to ensure seamless integration.

Example minimal interface for quick testing:

```go
package example

// UserQuery defines SQL template methods for User model
//
type UserQuery interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (User, error)
}

type User struct {
  ID   int
  Name string
}
```

Generate:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./example -o ./generated
```

Then build or run a test to confirm no compilation or runtime errors.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Setup">
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
Check if `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is included in your system PATH environment variable. Add it if missing to access the `gorm` command globally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Go Version Errors">
Double-check your Go version. GORM CLI requires Go 1.18 or later. Update Go by downloading it from the official site.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generation Command Fails with Input Errors">
Make sure the `-i` input path points to a valid Go interface file or directory containing SQL-annotated interfaces. Check for syntax errors or misplaced SQL template comments in your interface.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Generated Files After Running Gen">
Confirm your Go files contain valid interfaces and structs. If your package includes a `genconfig.Config`, verify it is correctly set to include your interfaces and structs, and that neither include nor exclude filters are unintentionally filtering out all targets.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Generated Code Fails to Compile">
Inspect your SQL templates and interface method signatures. Ensure each method returns an error as the final return value and that SQL templates are syntactically correct. Refer to the SQL Template DSL documentation for help.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Always keep your environment consistent and make sure you are using supported Go versions and paths. Problems during installation often arise from environment misconfiguration rather than the tool itself.
</Warning>
