# Key Features at a Glance

Discover the marquee capabilities of GORM CLI, a powerful code generator tailored for Go developers working with GORM. This page offers a rapid yet comprehensive overview of the core features that enable you to write type-safe, fluent database queries and operations effortlessly.

---

## Why GORM CLI? Unlocking Developer Productivity and Safety

GORM CLI revolutionizes how you interact with your database by generating:

- **Type-safe query APIs** derived directly from your Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates
- **Model-driven field helpers** to simplify filter, update, and association operations
- **Powerful template-based queries** that adapt dynamically to your input parameters
- **Flexible generation configuration** to tailor output to your project’s coding style
- **Seamless integration with GORM**, preserving idiomatic Go developer experience

Whether you want to avoid manual query string building or ensure compile-time SQL consistency, GORM CLI accelerates your workflow with confidence.

## Feature Highlights

### 1. Type-Safe Query APIs from Go Interfaces

Define your database operations declaratively as Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI generates: 

- Concrete methods with strong typing
- Automatic context handling for database calls
- Fluent, discoverable method signatures enabling rapid autocomplete and fewer runtime errors

**Example:**

```go
// Query[T any] interface with SQL template in comments
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

Use the generated API intuitively:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers for Filters, Updates & Associations

From your model structs, generate rich helpers for:

- Basic field predicates (e.g., `Eq`, `Between`, `Like`)
- Setting field values including zero-values and expressions
- Handling associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many2many) with operations like Create, Update, Unlink, Delete

**Concrete benefits:**

- Eliminates error-prone manual SQL
- Enables batch operations and conditional updates seamlessly
- Maintains compile-time type safety

**Example:**

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido"))).
  Update(ctx)
```

### 3. Template-Based Query Generation

Write flexible, dynamic SQL queries using a custom DSL embedded in Go interface method comments. Support includes:

- Named placeholders (`@param`) for automatic parameter binding
- Database table and column placeholders (`@@table`, `@@column`)
- Conditional WHERE and SET clause construction using `{{where}}` and `{{set}}`
- Iteration and branching (`{{for}}`, `{{if}}`) for complex query building

**Example snippet:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM @@table
{{where}}
  {{if name != ""}} name=@name {{end}}
  {{if age > 0}} AND age=@age {{end}}
{{end}}
```

### 4. Configurable Output & Field Mapping

Tailor generation behavior effortlessly through package-level configuration structs:

- Control output directories and file-level generation
- Whitelist or blacklist interfaces and structs by name or pattern
- Define custom field helper mappings for special data types (e.g., JSON)

This enables you to integrate cleanly into your project structure and coding conventions.

### 5. Seamless Integration with GORM

GORM CLI-generated code complements the official GORM APIs:

- Uses generics with `gorm.G[T](db)` to start fluent queries
- Supports GORM clauses and expressions for advanced operations
- Aligns with GORM’s idiomatic patterns, making handoffs smooth

---

## Typical User Journey

1. **Define** Go interfaces with SQL templates for crisp, declarative query definitions.
2. **Annotate** your models with optional tags to configure field helper generation.
3. **Run** the CLI tool to automatically generate strongly typed query APIs and field helpers.
4. **Use** the generated APIs in your code to write safe, elegant, and performant database operations.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Start with simple query interface definitions and incrementally add complexity using template DSL.
- Leverage the config file to exclude deprecated interfaces or tailor output.
- Use generated field helpers to enforce consistent filters and updates throughout your codebase.
- Test generated code for expected parameter binding and SQL output.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Missing Generated Methods:** Ensure interfaces contain properly formatted SQL template comments.
- **Incorrect Field Mapping:** Verify `genconfig.Config` settings, especially `FieldNameMap` and `FieldTypeMap`.
- **Compilation Errors:** Confirm Go version is 1.18+ for generics support.
- **Output Path Problems:** Double check the `-o` flag or config `OutPath`.
