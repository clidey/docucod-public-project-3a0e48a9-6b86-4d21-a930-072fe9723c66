# Integration & Ecosystem Compatibility

GORM CLI is designed to seamlessly integrate into the Go ecosystem, particularly projects using the GORM ORM. This page explains how GORM CLI fits naturally within your existing Go and GORM workflows, covers prerequisites and installation guidance, and highlights key touchpoints for smooth onboarding. Whether you are adopting GORM CLI for the first time or incorporating it into a mature codebase, understanding these integration points will set you up for success.

---

## Why Integration Matters

As a developer building applications with GORM, you rely on a robust, type-safe, and maintainable approach to database interactions. GORM CLI enhances this experience by generating strongly typed query APIs and field helpers tailored for your models—this means fewer runtime errors and faster coding with autocompletion.

However, to maximize these benefits, the CLI needs to plug cleanly into your existing Go project without disrupting workflows, build processes, or project conventions. This integration page clarifies how that is accomplished with minimal friction.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using GORM CLI, confirm your environment meets the following:

- **Go version 1.18 or later**: GORM CLI leverages Go generics and requires Go 1.18+.
- **GORM (gorm.io/gorm) as your ORM**: GORM CLI builds on GORM internals and expects GORM models and DB access mechanisms.
- **Go module-enabled project**: For optimal import management and path resolution.

This ensures GORM CLI can parse your model structs, generate type-safe code, and integrate with your GORM-based database handling.

---

## Installation

Easily install the latest release of GORM CLI with the standard Go toolchain:

```bash
# Install GORM CLI globally
 go install gorm.io/cli/gorm@latest
```

The CLI is then accessible as the `gorm` command in your terminal.

---

## How GORM CLI Fits Your Project Structure

GORM CLI operates by parsing your existing Go codebase—specifically model structs and raw SQL method interfaces—then generating additional Go code that enhances your developer workflow. Here's what it means in practice:

1. **Source Inputs:**
   - Your Go model definitions (usually in `models/` or similar packages).
   - Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates for query definitions.

2. **Code Generation Outputs:**
   - Generated code files with type-safe query API implementations.
   - Model-driven, strongly typed field helpers for building queries and updates.

3. **Placement:**
   - Output is placed in a configurable directory (default is `./g`), preserving package structure.
   - This keeps generated code modular and maintainable, avoiding conflicts.

4. **Build Integration:**
   - Generated code uses standard Go import paths and GORM idioms, so it compiles naturally with your existing project.

5. **Configuration Hooks:**
   - You can fine-tune generation, naming, and filtering with a `genconfig.Config` declaration directly inside your Go packages.

## Key Integration Touchpoints

### 1. Input Source Code Discovery

GORM CLI recursively processes your specified input directory or file containing your Go model structs and query interfaces. It respects your project’s package layout, import paths, and directory structure.

### 2. Configurable Generation with `genconfig.Config`

Place a package-level `genconfig.Config` variable in any package to customize generation behavior:

- Set the output directory (`OutPath`) to keep generated code where you want.
- Include or exclude specific interfaces or structs to focus generation.
- Map Go types or field tags to custom field helpers.
- Control per-file or per-package generation with `FileLevel`.

This hook ensures GORM CLI respects your project's architecture and coding standards without intrusive setup.

### 3. Output Directory & Package Consistency

The CLI preserves input directory structure within the output directory to keep package declarations and import paths consistent. This guarantees the generated code fits naturally with existing code.

### 4. Go Module Awareness

GORM CLI resolves package import paths based on Go module information, ensuring all generated imports target the correct modules. This avoids import cycles or incorrect paths.

### 5. Integration with Existing GORM Usage

Generated APIs return types and embed behaviors fully compatible with the `gorm.io/gorm` package. For example, you interact with generated queries as you would with GORM DB instances, but with type safety and fluent helpers.

You can combine generated query calls with hand-written GORM operations seamlessly.

---

## Practical Integration Example

Imagine your Go project with a `models` package and a query interface in the `queries` package:

```
myproject/
├─ models/
│  └─ user.go
├─ queries/
│  └─ user_query.go
├─ main.go
```

With GORM CLI, you can:

- Execute the generation command targeting `queries`:

  ```bash
gorm gen -i ./queries -o ./generated
  ```

- The CLI reads your models and query interfaces, generates strongly typed query APIs under `generated/queries` with the same package structure.

- Your application imports `generated/queries` and calls type-safe query methods with the confidence of compile-time checking.

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Ensure Go version 1.18+ is used.** Older Go versions won’t support generics, causing generation or runtime failures.

- **Keep model structs and query interfaces in reachable packages.** GORM CLI parses all directories below your specified input path.

- **Use `genconfig.Config` selectively to optimize generation**—exclude deprecated or unnecessary interfaces to speed up processing.

- **Run the generation step as part of your build or CI pipeline** to keep generated code up to date.

- **Review generated code to understand new APIs and improve usage patterns.**

---

## Summary

By understanding these integration points, you can confidently add GORM CLI to your workflow, enriching your GORM projects with type-safe APIs while preserving your existing project structure and dev practices. The CLI's design ensures minimal disruption and maximum synergy with the Go and GORM ecosystem.
