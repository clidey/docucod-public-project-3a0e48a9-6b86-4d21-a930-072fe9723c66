# Target Audience

GORM CLI is designed specifically for Go developers who demand speed, safety, and expressiveness when interfacing with databases via the GORM ORM. This page helps you understand exactly who benefits most from GORM CLI and why it aligns perfectly with their development needs.

## Who Is GORM CLI For?

### Individual Go Developers

Whether you're building a personal project, a prototype, or an internal tool, GORM CLI accelerates your workflow by generating type-safe, intuitive query APIs and model field helpers automatically. This means less manual coding, fewer runtime surprises, and more confidence in your data handling — all without adding complexity.

### Teams and Organizations

For teams working on production-grade applications, GORM CLI provides a shared foundation for clean, maintainable database code. It enforces compile-time safety, reducing integration errors early in the development cycle. Teams can achieve consistent patterns and fluent interfaces that improve code readability and collaboration across developers.

### Developers Focused on Maintainability and Safety

If you prioritize long-term maintainability and reducing bugs, GORM CLI’s generated APIs and helpers enforce a compile-time contract between your Go models and your database logic. This prevents a wide range of common runtime errors caused by mismatched types or invalid query construction.

### Users Leveraging Advanced GORM Features

GORM CLI is ideal if you want to leverage advanced GORM features like associations, polymorphic relations, and complex query templates with confidence. Generated field helpers and expressive query interfaces make it straightforward to manipulate relational data in a type-safe, discoverable manner.

## Why This Matters to You

### Speed and Productivity

Writing SQL and database interaction code manually is repetitive and error-prone. GORM CLI automates this process by generating ready-to-use, type-safe code based on your interfaces and models, letting you focus on your application's core logic.

### Early Error Detection

Instead of debugging runtime SQL errors, you get compile-time checks ensuring method signatures, field types, and query parameters are correct before you even run your code. It dramatically lowers debugging time and increases code stability.

### Consistency and Code Quality

Generated code follows consistent patterns and best practices, making your codebase cleaner and easier to maintain, especially as your application grows or when onboarding new team members.

### Seamless Integration

Designed to fit naturally into your existing Go and GORM workflow, GORM CLI composes with GORM’s query builder and supports all typical operations like create, update, unlink, and delete — including batch and association operations.

## Illustrative User Flow

Here’s a typical scenario demonstrating who uses GORM CLI and what they achieve:

1. **Define Your Models and Query Interfaces:**

   You write Go structs representing your database models and interfaces with SQL templates for your queries.

2. **Run GORM CLI to Generate Code:**

   With a single command, generate type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers tailored to your schema.

3. **Write Business Logic Using Generated APIs:**

   Use the generated fluent APIs to build queries and mutations with confidence, benefiting from autocomplete, type safety, and reduced boilerplate.

4. **Catch Errors at Compile-Time:**

   Any invalid query or mismatch between your Go code and the database schema surfaces during compilation, preventing costly runtime errors.

5. **Collaborate Seamlessly:**

   Your team shares a common interface and generated helpers, ensuring consistent interactions with the database.

## Practical Tips

- **Start Small:** You can adopt GORM CLI incrementally — generate code for just a few models or interfaces to familiarize yourself with the workflow.
  
- **Leverage Configuration:** Use `genconfig.Config` to tailor generation, such as including or excluding specific interfaces or structs, mapping custom field types, or adjusting output paths.

- **Explore Associations Early:** Take advantage of prebuilt helpers for relational data to simplify complex operations.

- **Combine With SQL Templates:** Use method comments to embed flexible queries that the generator converts into safe, optimized code.

- **Integrate Into CI/CD:** Automate the generation step to ensure your generated code is always up-to-date and consistently applied across environments.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Ignoring Generated Code:** Not integrating or reviewing the generated code limits the value of GORM CLI.

- **Misconfiguring Includes/Excludes:** Careful configuration ensures you only generate relevant parts of your codebase.

- **Skipping Testing:** Although generation reduces bugs, thorough testing of the generated APIs in your application context is essential.
