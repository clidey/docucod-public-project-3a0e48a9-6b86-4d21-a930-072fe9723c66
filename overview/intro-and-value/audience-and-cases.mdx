title: "Who Should Use GORM CLI?"
description: "Built for Go developers using GORM and seeking safer, more maintainable database code—GORM CLI is ideal for teams working on medium to large projects, or anyone needing customized, interface-driven query logic. Whether designing scalable APIs or maintaining data consistency, discover your fit with GORM CLI."

# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is purpose-built for Go developers who work closely with GORM and want to elevate their database interaction patterns through type-safe, maintainable code generation. This page helps you identify if GORM CLI fits your project needs by describing the ideal users, teams, and project scenarios that gain the most value from this powerful tool.

## Empowering Go Developers with Safer, Scalable Database Code

If you write Go applications that rely on GORM for data access, you know the challenges of balancing flexibility and type safety in your queries and mutations. GORM CLI transforms this experience by generating interface-driven, type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers that safeguard your code.

GORM CLI is not for everyone — it shines most when your project requires robust query logic, strong compile-time guarantees, and clear code discoverability.

---

## Who Benefits Most from GORM CLI?

### 1. Medium to Large-Scale Go Teams

- Teams maintaining significant codebases where SQL query complexity and evolving database schemas raise the risk of bugs.
- Projects that require clean separation between query definitions and database execution.
- Teams aiming to reduce runtime errors with compile-time validation through generated code.

**Why it matters:** As projects grow, manually writing and managing raw SQL queries or dynamic GORM queries can become brittle. GORM CLI centralizes your query logic in interfaces with SQL templates, automatically converting them into consistent, type-safe methods.

### 2. Developers Requiring Customized, Interface-Driven Query Logic

- Developers who want fine-grained control over SQL generation embedded in Go interfaces.
- Teams needing SQL templating with placeholders, conditional clauses, and iteration patterns handled safely and declaratively.

**Why it matters:** Writing complex queries with conditional WHERE or SET clauses becomes straightforward with GORM CLI’s SQL template DSL inside interface comments — eliminating tedious boilerplate and error-prone string concatenation.

### 3. Projects That Demand Consistency and Maintainability

- Codebases aiming to keep model definitions and query logic synchronized.
- Teams that want to prevent frequent bugs caused by mistyped column names, mismatched types, or unhandled nil/NULL values.

**Why it matters:** GORM CLI generates field helpers based on your model structs, supporting both basic and association fields. This enables strongly typed filters, updates, and association operations throughout your application.

### 4. Developers Designing Scalable APIs with Complex Associations

- Applications involving multiple related child tables: has-one, has-many, many-to-many, polymorphic relationships.
- Need for concise, type-safe APIs to manage association operations (create, update, unlink, delete).

**Why it matters:** Managing associations manually is cumbersome and error-prone. GORM CLI’s generated helpers encapsulate these operations with compile-time checks, ensuring data consistency and easing complex workflows.

---

## Real-World Scenarios

- **A startup growing their backend** with expanding data relationships and complex query filtering logic, needing to solidify their code quality and accelerate development.

- **An engineering team refactoring legacy dynamic queries** into declarative interfaces backed by safe, generated code for easier maintenance and better collaboration.

- **A SaaS provider building type-safe APIs** that leverage GORM with custom SQL logic embedded in method templates, enhancing API discoverability and reducing runtime SQL bugs.

---

## When You Might Not Need GORM CLI

- Small projects or prototypes with minimal database complexity where the overhead of code generation outweighs benefits.
- Use cases where dynamic raw SQL queries that cannot be expressed in interfaces dominate.

<Tip>
If you are part of a team, convincing others with clear examples of improved safety and code maintainability using your own models is the best way to showcase GORM CLI’s impact.
</Tip>

<Info>
GORM CLI complements GORM itself and integrates seamlessly without requiring you to abandon familiar tools. It provides a layer of generated, type-safe APIs that reduce bugs and accelerate development.
