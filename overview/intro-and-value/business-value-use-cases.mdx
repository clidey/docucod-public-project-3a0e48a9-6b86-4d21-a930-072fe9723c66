# Product Value & Use Cases

Unlock the full potential of your Go projects with GORM CLI — a powerful tool designed to seamlessly generate type-safe, expressive, and maintainable database code. This page dives into the tangible benefits GORM CLI delivers, illustrating how it transforms everyday development challenges into streamlined workflows.

## Why GORM CLI Matters for Your Go Projects

### Cutting Boilerplate and Reducing Runtime Errors
Working directly with SQL or raw database code invites repetitive boilerplate and subtle bugs. GORM CLI eradicates these issues by creating compile-time checked APIs generated from your Go interfaces and models:

- **Minimized Manual SQL**: Write SQL templates just once in interfaces; GORM CLI generates the robust, typed methods for you.
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Catch invalid queries, mismatched types, or missing parameters before running your application.
- **Consistent Patterns**: Gain predictable, idiomatic query APIs that reduce cognitive load and improve maintainability.

### An Integrated Workflow with GORM
GORM CLI tightly integrates with the familiar `gorm.io/gorm` ecosystem, delivering:

- Fluent, discoverable query interfaces allowing rich SQL templating within Go code.
- Model-driven field helpers that empower expressive, type-safe filter and update expressions.
- Association helpers for seamless handling of complex relationships like `has many`, `belongs to`, and `many2many`.

This synergy means you keep your productivity while elevating code quality.

## Core Use Cases Where GORM CLI Excels

### 1. Rapid API Development with Type-Safe Queries
By defining your query interfaces with SQL templates in comments, you instantly gain:

- **Automatic code generation** of methods matching your SQL intent, with strongly typed function signatures.
- **Context injection** and parameter binding handled for you, reducing boilerplate and mistakes.

For example, retrieving a user by ID:
```go
// In your interface
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Generated usage
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

This approach accelerates prototyping and scaling your API layer with confidence.

### 2. Maintainable Model Management via Field Helpers
GORM CLI produces model-driven field helpers that capture predicates, setters, and expressions for all your model fields:

- Write expressive filters like `generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)` or `generated.User.Name.Like("%smith%")`.
- Perform safe updates with setter functions, e.g., `generated.User.Status.Set("active")`.
- Handle `NULL` and zero-values explicitly, avoiding ambiguous SQL semantics.

Example update:
```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("Alice"),
    generated.User.Age.Incr(1),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

### 3. Streamlined Team Collaboration with Type-Safe Patterns
Teams benefit hugely from GORM CLI’s consistent code generation patterns:

- Standardized query APIs reduce onboarding time and cognitive overhead.
- Type safety enforces correct usage of data structures, minimizing runtime surprises.
- Configurable generation allows adoption across diverse projects with custom mappings and filters.

## Before and After GORM CLI Adoption

| Aspect                 | Before GORM CLI                              | After GORM CLI                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Query Definition       | Handwritten SQL strings in code             | SQL templates in interfaces with generation    |
| Type Safety            | Limited, prone to runtime errors             | Compile-time checked, safe query methods       |
| Boilerplate            | Manual code for queries and parameters       | Generated fluent APIs reduce manual work       |
| Handling Associations  | Ad-hoc and error-prone                        | Semantics encapsulated in generated helpers   |
| Code Discoverability   | Hidden SQL strings and manual mappings       | Clear method signatures and field helpers     |

## Examples of GORM CLI Impact

### Rapid API Development Example
Defining a query interface with templated SQL method comments:
```go
// Query interface
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// Using generated method
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 42)
```
Generates code that safely binds parameters, executes queries, and returns typed results.

### Enhanced Model Filters Example
Filtering users by name and age range:
```go
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(
    generated.User.Name.Like("%doe%"),
    generated.User.Age.Between(25, 40),
  ).
  Find(ctx)
```
This expressive, typesafe approach saves you from writing custom where clauses and guards against SQL injection.

### Association Management Example
Managing related entities with clear semantics:
```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido"))).
  Create(ctx)
```
Creates and associates a new pet with the user in one fluent statement.

## Best Practices for Maximizing GORM CLI Value

- **Define clear interfaces** with comprehensive SQL templates capturing all common queries.
- **Leverage model-driven field helpers** to build filters and updates incrementally and type-safely.
- **Use generation config** to map custom field types (e.g., JSON, nullable time) for consistent representation.
- **Collaborate on shared interfaces** within teams to maintain uniform API contracts.
- **Incorporate generated code into testing** to catch SQL/logic errors early through integration.

## Getting Started Preview

Ready to experience these benefits?

1. **Write your query interfaces** and model structs in Go with method comments embedding SQL queries.
2. **Run `gorm gen` CLI** with appropriate flags to generate your code artifacts.
3. **Use the generated APIs** in your application to enjoy type-safe, expressive, and maintainable database access.
