# What is GORM CLI?

## Empowering Go Developers with Type-Safe Database Access

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed specifically for Go developers working with the GORM ORM. It transforms your Go interfaces and model structs into fully type-safe, interface-driven query APIs and expressive model-driven field helpers. This bridges the gap between your Go code and SQL database transactions, delivering compile-time safety while maintaining fluid usability.

### Why GORM CLI Matters to You

Imagine writing database queries without repeatedly crafting raw SQL strings or manually handling query parameters. GORM CLI enables you to define Go interfaces annotated with your desired SQL logic directly in comments — then automatically generates concrete, type-checked methods you can call with confidence.

At the same time, it generates rich, strongly typed helpers from your model structs for filters, updates, and relationship management. This allows you to reason about your data at a higher abstraction level, focus on your application logic, and reduce runtime errors caused by mismatched types or malformed queries.

### Core Value Propositions

- **Type Safety From Day One:** Eliminate common database query mistakes by enforcing compiler checks against your query interfaces.
- **Fluent, Discoverable API:** Use generated query methods and field helpers that provide clear, meaningful method names and chaining support.
- **Keep Code Clean and Maintainable:** Avoid scattering raw SQL strings and parameter boilerplate across your codebase.
- **Seamless GORM Integration:** Generated code works natively with GORM’s `*gorm.DB` and query builders, preserving your workflow.
- **Customizable Generation:** Configure generation rules per package or interface to tailor output precisely to your project’s needs.

### Who Should Care About GORM CLI?

This tool is essential for Go developers and teams who:

- Use GORM extensively and want stronger guarantees about their database query correctness.
- Maintain complex projects requiring clean query APIs and reusable model-centric query helpers.
- Value productivity boosts from automation while retaining full control over SQL behavior via interface-based templates.
- Wish to reduce the gap between database schema, application models, and query logic.

### How GORM CLI Works

GORM CLI reads your Go interface definitions that contain SQL template comments. Each interface method represents a database query operation:

1. **Interface-Driven Generation:** You write a generic interface with Go method declarations and embed SQL query logic in comments.
2. **Parsing and Processing:** The CLI parses these interfaces, analyzes method signatures, parameters, and SQL templates.
3. **Code Generation:** It generates ready-to-use Go implementations with type-safe methods that wrap raw SQL execution with GORM.
4. **Model-Based Helpers:** From your domain model structs, GORM CLI generates helper fields and association operators, making filter and update expression creation smooth and error-free.

This process brings templated SQL queries from simple text into first-class Go code supporting generics and fluent composition.


### Example: Writing Your Query Interface

```go
// Define a generic query interface with SQL templates in method comments
// Your interface drives the API generation

type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table
  // {{where}}
  //   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
  //   {{if user.Age > 0}} AND age=@user.Age {{end}}
  // {{end}}
  SearchUsers(user User) ([]T, error)
}
```

### Example: Generated Type-Safe Usage

```go
// Generated code allows:
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

users, err := generated.Query[User](db).
  SearchUsers(ctx, User{Name: "jinzhu"})

// Fluent, composable, and type-checked
```

### Summary

GORM CLI transforms the way you write your database queries in Go by turning interfaces and structs into powerful, type-safe, and maintainable database access layers while fully leveraging the GORM ecosystem.
