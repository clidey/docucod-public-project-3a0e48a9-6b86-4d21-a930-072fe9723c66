# Who Should Use GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool tailored specifically for Go developers working with GORM. This page helps you determine if GORM CLI is the right fit for your project by highlighting its ideal users, their goals, and how it solves common pain points in data access and manipulation.

## Unlock Type-Safe Development for GORM Projects

If you are a Go developer leveraging the GORM ORM and want to bring compile-time safety, developer productivity, and maintainability to your data access layer, GORM CLI is designed for you. It targets those who value strong typing, predictable query construction, and the elimination of common runtime errors related to SQL string construction.

### Ideal Users of GORM CLI

- **Go Developers Using GORM:** If your project relies on GORM for database interaction, GORM CLI seamlessly integrates to enhance your existing workflows without changing your ORM.

- **Teams Seeking Type-Safe Query APIs:** Writing raw SQL or string-based queries can lead to subtle bugs and runtime errors. GORM CLI converts your interface definitions into fully typed query methods, ensuring errors are caught during compilation rather than in production.

- **Developers Managing Complex Data Logic:** When your data access patterns grow intricate—especially with templated SQL logic, conditional queries, or multi-layered filtering—GORM CLI helps encode this complexity into reusable, tested templates.

- **Those Looking to Automate and Streamline Code:** Don't waste precious time writing or updating boilerplate code for queries and model fields. GORM CLI generates everything automatically from your interfaces and model structs.

### Common User Intent and Goals

- **Generate Type-Safe Query APIs From Interfaces:** Write expressive Go interfaces with SQL snippets in comments and auto-generate concrete, fluent implementations.

- **Obtain Model-Driven Field Helpers:** Automatically extract fields from your structs and create helpers for filtering, updating, ordering, and associations with type safety.

- **Enforce Consistency and Reduce Duplication:** Centralize your query definitions and data field access in one place and generate consistent, maintainable API layers.

- **Control Generation via Configuration:** Use flexible config options to include/exclude specific interfaces or types, define output paths, and customize field types.


## How GORM CLI Addresses Your Needs

The tool focuses on what you want to achieve — safe, clear, and maintainable database access code — without forcing complex frameworks or new paradigms. Instead, it enhances your existing GORM models and SQL workflows with generated code that saves time and improves correctness.

Example scenario:

```go
// You define a query interface with embedded SQL templates
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (User, error)

// You define model structs with rich associations
// type User struct {
//    ID   uint
//    Name string
//    Pets []*Pet
// }

// Running GORM CLI generates:
// - A `Query` implementation with a strongly typed GetByID method.
// - Field helpers like `User.Name.Eq(string)` and `User.Pets.Create(...)` with compile-time checks.
```

## Benefits and Practical Outcomes

- **Increased Developer Confidence:** Type-safe methods prevent incorrect parameter types or missing SQL bindings.
- **Reduced Runtime Errors:** SQL fragments are templated and validated in code generation, dramatically reducing injection and logic errors.
- **Faster Development:** Write concise, maintainable code; rely on GORM CLI for repetitive code generation.
- **Easier Maintenance and Refactoring:** Change the interface or model once; regenerate consistent code.

### Examples of Where GORM CLI Excels

- Building complex, parameterized SQL queries with conditional templating.
- Managing models with layered, polymorphic, or many-to-many associations.
- Teams enforcing strict code standards and type safety in database operations.
- Projects requiring clean, discoverable, and fluent query APIs.

## Next Steps to Evaluate GORM CLI

1. Review your current query and model patterns to identify opportunities for typed query interfaces.
2. Explore [Defining Models and Query Interfaces](/getting-started/first-code-generation/defining-models-and-interfaces) to see how your code maps.
3. Use the [Running the Code Generator](/getting-started/first-code-generation/running-gorm-cli-gen) guide to generate your first code and experiment.
4. If you work with associations or custom field types, reference [Working with Associations: Patterns & Best Practices](/guides/advanced-use-cases/associations-best-practices) and [Customizing Code Generation with genconfig](/guides/advanced-use-cases/customizing-generation).

<Tip>
If you value compile-time safety and fluent APIs but are hesitant about adding complexity, GORM CLI strikes a balance by integrating naturally with your GORM models without rewriting your codebase.
