# What is GORM CLI?

GORM CLI is a powerful open-source command-line tool specifically designed to enhance your development workflow when working with [GORM](https://gorm.io/), the popular ORM library for Go. It automatically generates interface-driven, type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers based on your Go interfaces and model structs, enabling you to write safer and more fluent database access code.

---

## Unlock Compile-Time Safety with Fluent APIs

Imagine writing complex database queries with full confidence that your code matches your schema and query intents — without endless manual SQL strings or unsafe type assertions. GORM CLI transforms your handwritten interfaces and model definitions into concrete, type-safe APIs that 

- prevent common bugs early through compile-time checks
- provide clear, discoverable method calls for queries and mutations
- eliminate the repetitive boilerplate involved in standard GORM usage

Whether you're building simple CRUD operations or advanced queries with conditional logic and associations, GORM CLI makes your database access code robust and maintainable.

### Core Value Propositions
- **Type-Safe Query APIs**: Define your database queries in Go interfaces using intuitive SQL templates; generate strongly typed, safe implementations automatically.
- **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: Gain strongly typed field and association helpers from your model structs — speed up building filters, updates, and association operations.
- **Compile-Time Guarantee**: Catch potential mistakes at build time rather than runtime.
- **Seamless GORM Integration**: Automatically generated code works directly with `gorm.io/gorm` for smooth developer experience.
- **Configurable Generation**: Customize output directories, included interfaces and structs, and field mappings via a user-friendly config.

### Who Should Use GORM CLI?

This tool is designed for Go developers using GORM who want to improve code safety and productivity by automating query API and helper generation. It is especially suited for teams maintaining complex data access layers or anyone aiming to reduce boilerplate code in database operations.

## What Is GORM CLI?

At its heart, GORM CLI is a command-line generator that takes the structured input you provide via your Go interface definitions and model structs, then produces ready-to-use, type-safe code to interact with your database via GORM. It empowers you to write queries in a simple, declarative manner and lets the tool handle code scaffolding.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

Managing database queries and mutations manually in Go with GORM often involves writing raw SQL strings, handling parameters safely, and juggling field names as strings. This is error-prone and makes refactoring painful. GORM CLI eliminates these pain points by generating:

- **Query method implementations** with SQL templates embedded in interface comments, automatically parsed and translated into Go methods.
- **Field helpers** that represent your model’s columns and associations as fluent, type-safe builders for filtering, updates, and deletions.

### How Does It Work?

You write Go interfaces and model structs annotated with SQL templates or tags. Running `gorm gen` processes these inputs, parsing interfaces, extracting annotated SQL or DSL, and reading struct metadata to generate the corresponding query APIs and helpers.

The generator respects optional configuration files (`genconfig.Config`) allowing you to fine-tune:

- Which interfaces and structs to include or exclude
- Output paths for generated code
- Field type mappings for special cases like JSON or time fields

This process yields a set of auto-generated Go code files that provide a fluent, compile-time safe API to perform database operations.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Interface-Driven, Type-Safe Query APIs

Define interfaces with Go generics to express your queries, annotating methods with SQL templates:

```go
// Example Query Interface
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // Conditional SQL with DSL
  // {{where}}
  //   {{if @user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
  // {{end}}
  SearchUsers(user User) ([]T, error)

  // Update with dynamic SET clause
  // {{set}}
  //   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name, {{end}}
  // {{end}}
  UpdateUser(user User, id int) error
}
```

The CLI creates concrete implementations of these interfaces, letting you write:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

with full type safety and parameter binding handled for you.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers

From your Go structs representing database models, GORM CLI generates strongly typed field helpers.

```go
// User model example
type User struct {
  ID   uint
  Name string
  Age  int
}
```

You get fluent helpers like:

```go
generated.User.Name.Eq("alice")         // Builds 'name = "alice"'
generated.User.Age.Between(18, 65)       // Builds 'age BETWEEN 18 AND 65'
```

which you use in querying or updates:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)
```

### 3. Safe and Flexible Association Operations

Association helpers enable sophisticated operations on relationships:

- Create and link related records (single or batch)
- Update associated records with filters
- Unlink or Delete relationships safely

```go
// Create user with pet
gorm.G[User](db).Set(
  generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
  generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
).Create(ctx)
```

### 4. Advanced Template SQL DSL

The tool supports a robust templating DSL within interface method comments, allowing conditional clauses, dynamic columns, and iteration to build flexible queries.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM @@table
{{where}}
  {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name {{end}}
  {{if user.Age > 0}} AND age=@user.Age {{end}}
{{end}}
```

### 5. Configurable Code Generation

Control generation behavior with declarative Go configs specifying inclusion patterns, file-level overrides, field mappings (e.g., custom JSON handling), and output directories.

## Why Should You Care?

### What Outcomes Can You Expect?

- **Increased Developer Productivity**: Less boilerplate, faster iteration.
- **Reduced Runtime Errors**: Compile-time checks prevent invalid queries.
- **Improved Code Maintainability**: Clear, typed APIs clarify intent and support refactoring.
- **Consistent Query Patterns**: Helps enforce uniform query structures across teams.

### Common Use Cases

- Building scalable microservices where safe data access is paramount.
- Complex business applications with rich relational data models.
- Teams practicing Test-Driven Development and seeking early failure detection.

### Before and After

| Without GORM CLI                         | With GORM CLI                             |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Unsafe raw SQL strings scattered in code | Fluent method calls with type safety     |
| Manual SQL parameter management        | Automated parameter binding and validation |
| Repetitive filtering and update boilerplate | Reusable generated helpers and APIs      |

### Return on Investment

- Save hours weekly by letting the generator produce repetitive code.
- Avoid subtle bugs caused by typos or mismatched SQL parameters.
- Empower new team members to understand data access more quickly.
