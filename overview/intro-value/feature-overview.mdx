# Feature Overview at a Glance

Unlock the full power of GORM CLI with its robust, type-safe code generation capabilities designed specifically for Go developers who want expressive, efficient, and error-resistant database access.

GORM CLI synthesizes your Go interfaces and model structs into two complementary code layers: type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers, providing a seamless developer experience with compile-time safety and fluent usage.

## What Does This Page Cover?
This page distills the essential features of GORM CLI into a clear, concise list to give you an immediate sense of what the tool offers and why it matters for your development workflow.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Type-Safe Query APIs from Interfaces
- **Write your query methods as Go interfaces with SQL templates in comments.**
- GORM CLI generates strongly typed, concrete implementations.
- Auto-injects context parameters for streamlined use.

**Benefit:** Catch mistakes at compile time and avoid runtime errors from invalid queries.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers
- Generate helper objects from your model structs.
- Helpers cover common predicates (e.g., Eq, Like, Between) and setters.
- Support for basic field types like ints, floats, strings, bools, times, and byte slices.

**Benefit:** Simplify query building and updates with discoverable, type-checked expressions.

### 3. Safe, Expressive Association Operations
- Full support for GORM relationship types: has-one, has-many, belongs-to, many-to-many, including polymorphic.
- Operations include Create, CreateInBatch, Update, Unlink, and Delete.
- All association helpers provide compile-time safety to avoid foreign key and data integrity mistakes.

**Benefit:** Manage complex data relationships confidently and efficiently.

### 4. Flexible Code Generation Configuration
- Define per-package or per-directory generation behaviors using `genconfig.Config`.
- Configure output paths, include/exclude patterns for interfaces and structs.
- Customize field type mappings and named field helper assignments via `FieldTypeMap` and `FieldNameMap`.
- Supports wildcard filtering for selective code generation.

**Benefit:** Tailor generation to suit project structures and custom coding standards.

### 5. Deep Integration with GORM Ecosystem
- Generated code depends on the latest `gorm.io/gorm` types and interfaces.
- Generates idiomatic Go code adhering to GORM conventions.
- Supports GORM’s `clause.Expression` interface for query composition.

**Benefit:** Ensure compatibility and maximize reusability of existing GORM features.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Type-Safe Query APIs**    | Interface-based generation of query implementations with SQL templates | Safer, clearer query definitions with compile-time validation |
| **Field Helpers**           | Model-based predicates and setters for filters, ordering, updates     | Fluent, discoverable syntax for building complex queries      |
| **Association Operations**  | Safe create/update/unlink/delete on related data using generated helpers | Robust management of relational data, preventing common mistakes |
| **Configurable Generation** | Customize outpaths, include/exclude filters, and field mappings         | Fine control over generation, fits any project structure        |
| **GORM Integration**        | Uses GORM idioms and types, compatible with `gorm.io/gorm`             | Seamless developer experience and ecosystem alignment          |

## Real-World Usage Example

Imagine you have a `User` model and want to quickly create a query API plus helpers for all fields and associations. Here's what the workflow looks like after generation:

```go
// Using generated type-safe query API
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// Build a filter query with fluent field helpers
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
    Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
    Where(generated.User.Name.Like("%john%")).
    Find(ctx)
```

For relationships:

```go
// Create a user with associated pets
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This approach slashes boilerplate, prevents SQL injection issues, and provides a type-safe developer experience.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Write interfaces with clear SQL templates:** Use the template DSL thoughtfully to express your queries.
- **Define your models with relevant struct tags:** Leverage `gen:"name"` tags for custom helper mapping.
- **Configure selectively:** Use `genconfig.Config` to exclude deprecated interfaces or limit generation scope.
- **Use fluent chaining:** Combine generated helpers with GORM’s query builder for flexible queries.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Missing context parameter warning:** GORM CLI auto-injects `context.Context` if omitted. Avoid manually adding it redundantly.
- **Incorrect return types:** Query interface methods must return either an error or `(T, error)`.
- **Empty generation outputs:** Check your `genconfig.Config` include/exclude patterns; they might filter out all targets.
