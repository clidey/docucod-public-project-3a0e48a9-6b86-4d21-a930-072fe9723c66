# What is GORM CLI?

## Unlock Type-Safe, Fluent Query APIs for GORM Projects

GORM CLI is a powerful tool designed to streamline Go projects that use GORM by generating type-safe, interface-driven query APIs along with model-driven field helpers. With GORM CLI, you gain compile-time verification, expressive querying, and simplified handling of complex associations—all through generated code that integrates naturally with your models.

### Why Use GORM CLI?

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Detect query errors before runtime by leveraging Go's type system.
- **Expressive Queries:** Write concise, fluent, and discoverable APIs for common CRUD and complex association operations.
- **Simplified Associations:** Manage relationships like has-many, belongs-to, and many-to-many seamlessly with generated helpers.
- **Customizable Generation:** Tailor the output using configuration for field mapping, inclusion filters, and output paths.

### Who is This For?

Developers building Go applications with GORM who want:
- Safe, reusable query building blocks.
- Easier management of relational data.
- Maintainable code with clear contracts for database operations.

## What is GORM CLI? A High-Level Introduction

At its core, GORM CLI reads your Go model structs and raw SQL-annotated Go interfaces to produce two complementary types of code:

### 1. Interface-Driven Type-Safe Query APIs
Develop your query logic as Go interfaces with annotated SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI generates concrete implementations that:
- Bind parameters safely following your method signatures.
- Provide fluent, method-based access to CRUD operations.
- Auto-inject `context.Context` for concurrency and cancellation.

### 2. Model-Driven Field Helpers
From your model structs, GORM CLI generates strongly typed helpers for:
- Basic fields (integers, strings, times, etc.) with predicates and updates.
- Associations reflecting relationships (has one/many, belongs to, many-to-many).

Together, these enable you to write queries and updates that are both expressive and guarded by the compiler.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### Type-Safe Query APIs from Interface SQL Templates
- Write methods with SQL embedded in comments using a simple DSL (e.g., placeholders like `@@table`, conditional blocks).
- GORM CLI generates concrete implementations that safely bind method parameters for queries and updates.

### Model-Driven Field Helpers for Fluent Filtering and Updates
- Generates helper objects for each model field enabling predicates like `Eq()`, `Like()`, `Between()`, and update setters.

### Association Operations With Compile-Time Guarantees
- Supported operations include `Create`, `Update`, `Unlink`, `Delete`, and `CreateInBatch`.
- Handles `belongs to`, `has one`, `has many`, and `many-to-many` relationships correctly.

### Customizable Generation
- Control output location, included interfaces and structs, and field mapping via a Go configuration object (`genconfig.Config`).

### Seamless Integration
- Generated APIs integrate directly with `gorm.io/gorm` allowing you to decorate queries with generated predicates and updates.

## How GORM CLI Helps You: Real-World Context

Imagine you need to find users by ID, filter by complex criteria, and update nested relations. Without GORM CLI, you risk runtime errors from malformed queries and verbose, error-prone SQL string concatenations.

With GORM CLI, you:
- Define a `Query` interface with clean, documented methods accompanied by SQL templates.
- Generate implementations and field helpers.
- Use generated APIs to write elegant, error-checked code like:

```go
// Fetch a user by ID
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)

// Filter users older than 18
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)

// Create a user with pets linked via association helpers
err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

This approach ensures queries respect type contracts and association constraints, reducing bugs and improving developer productivity.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start Steps

1. **Write Your Query Interface with SQL Templates**
   Create Go interfaces with methods annotated by SQL comments using placeholders like `@@table`.

2. **Define Your Models**
   Keep structs defining your data shapes in the same or accessible packages.

3. **Generate Code**
   Run the GORM CLI command:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

4. **Use Generated APIs**
   Import and use the generated package for safe, idiomatic database code.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or later (for generics support).
- A GORM project with models defined.

### Next Steps

After mastering the basics shown here:
- Explore [Project Configuration](/getting-started/first-steps/project-configuration) to customize generation.
- Dive into [Using Type-Safe Query APIs](/guides/core-workflows/using-type-safe-query-apis) for practical examples.
- Learn to manage complex associations in [Working with Associations](/guides/advanced-patterns/working-with-associations).

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Start with small query interfaces and grow complexity gradually.
- Use configuration to map custom field types (e.g., JSON fields).
- Leverage association helpers for safer and concise relational updates.
- Run database migrations to ensure schema matches your models before generation.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Missing Generated Files?**
  Ensure your input files contain valid interfaces with SQL annotations.
- **Type Mismatches?**
  Verify method return types and argument names match your SQL parameters.
- **Association Operations Not Working?**
  Check your model definitions for proper GORM tags representing relationships.

## Summary
GORM CLI empowers Go developers to leverage type-safe, interface-driven queries and model-aware helpers for their GORM projects. It dramatically reduces runtime errors by moving query verification to compile time while simplifying relational data handling.

Get started now to write safer database code that is easier to maintain and extend.
