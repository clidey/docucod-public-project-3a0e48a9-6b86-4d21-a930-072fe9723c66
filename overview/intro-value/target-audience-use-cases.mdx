# Target Audience & Use Cases

GORM CLI is designed specifically for Go developers leveraging the GORM ORM to interact with relational databases. Its generated code enhances the standard GORM experience by delivering stronger compile-time safety, richer code completion, and a structured, discoverable API for crafting database queries and managing associations. This page explains precisely who gains the most from GORM CLI and presents practical scenarios where it accelerates development and improves maintainability.

## Who Benefits Most from GORM CLI?

- **Go Developers Using GORM**: If you write Go applications that rely on GORM for database access, GORM CLI elevates your workflow by turning your models and interfaces into expressive, type-safe query APIs.

- **Teams Seeking Compile-Time Safety**: Minimize runtime errors by catching SQL or API misuses early in the development cycle through generated type-safe methods.

- **Developers Focused on Productivity & Readability**: Auto-generated code reduces boilerplate and enhances discoverability, allowing developers to write more concise and expressive database interactions.

- **Projects Requiring Complex Queries or Associations**: Managing complex queries or relational associations can be cumbersome and error-prone. GORM CLI simplifies this with fluent APIs and clear association operations.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Rapid CRUD Generation

Generate idiomatic, type-safe CRUD operations for your models by simply defining query interfaces and models. For example, writing a query interface method like `GetByID(id int)` automatically creates a method to safely retrieve a record by ID:

```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

This eliminates repetitive query code and guards against SQL injection or parameter mismatches.

---

### 2. Complex, Condition-Driven Queries

Implement rich query logic using conditions, lists, and dynamic parameters through the SQL template DSL without losing type safety:

```go
users, err := generated.Query[User](db).FilterWithColumn(ctx, "role", "special")
```

Handle optional filters and compound predicates efficiently, allowing you to express sophisticated database queries with minimal code.

---

### 3. Type-Safe Updates & Batch Operations

Update model fields or associated objects with generated setters ensuring correct types and mappings, including batch creation or update of related records:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Update(ctx)
```

This provides an intuitive API for managing data mutations along with associations within one fluent call.

---

### 4. Safe & Discoverable Association Management

GORM CLI generates helpers for all associations (has one, has many, belongs to, many to many, including polymorphic), guiding users on supported operations like create, update, unlink, and delete with compile-time safeguards:

```go
// Remove association link (FK null or join table rows)
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Unlink()).
  Update(ctx)
```

This significantly reduces bugs related to mishandling foreign keys or join tables.

---

### 5. Domain-Specific Query Interface Development

By defining query interfaces with embedded SQL templates, you get strongly typed, self-documenting API methods tailored to your project’s needs:

```go
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE @@column=@value
  FilterWithColumn(column string, value string) (T, error)

  // UPDATE @@table
  // {{set}}
  //   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name, {{end}}
  //   {{if user.Age > 0}} age=@user.Age, {{end}}
  //   {{if user.Age >= 18}} is_adult=1 {{else}} is_adult=0 {{end}}
  // {{end}}
  // WHERE id=@id
  UpdateInfo(user User, id int) error
}
```

The generator creates matching implementations that integrate seamlessly with GORM’s DB instance.

## Before and After Using GORM CLI

| Aspect                       | Before GORM CLI                                    | After GORM CLI                                    |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Error Detection**           | Runtime errors from incorrect queries or params | Compile-time safety catching method and param errors|
| **Code Volume**               | Manual, repetitive SQL and association code      | Generated, concise, type-safe query APIs          |
| **Association Handling**      | Manual FK and join table management               | Fluent, typed helpers to manage relations safely  |
| **Query Clarity & Readability**| Raw SQL strings or dynamic GORM methods           | Clear, expressively named methods and helpers     |

---

## Practical Benefits

- **Speed Up Development**: Auto-generate essential query code to spend more time on business logic.
- **Increase Confidence**: Strong typing reduces risks of subtle bugs caused by incorrect SQL or parameter mismatches.
- **Improve Maintainability**: Generated APIs promote standardized, readable codebases.
- **Optimize Team Collaboration**: Shared generated query interfaces provide a contract all team members understand and use.
