# What is GORM CLI?

## Empowering Go Developers with Type-Safe, Interface-Driven Data Access

GORM CLI is a powerful code generation tool designed to elevate how Go developers build data access layers using GORM, the popular Go ORM. By transforming your interface definitions and model structs into type-safe, fluent query APIs and model-driven field helpers, GORM CLI ensures that your database interactions are reliable, discoverable, and compile-time safe.

---

## Unlocking Safer, More Maintainable Data Access

Data access code can easily become a source of bugs and complexity in Go applications. Manually crafting SQL queries or relying on string-based query builders often leads to runtime errors and hard-to-maintain code. GORM CLI addresses these challenges by automating code generation with these strengths:

- **Type Safety:** Generate query interfaces that catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.
- **Fluent APIs:** Use intuitive, discoverable methods generated from your own interfaces and models.
- **Model-Based Helpers:** Gain helpers for fields and associations that enable expressive filters, updates, and relationship operations.

Through this automation, developers can focus on business logic instead of boilerplate SQL and error-prone query code.

---

## What Exactly Does GORM CLI Do?

GORM CLI generates two key components from your existing Go code:

1. **Type-Safe Query APIs**: Define Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates in comments. GORM CLI generates matching concrete implementations where method calls translate to fully type-safe SQL queries. This pattern lets you express queries clearly and get immediate feedback from the compiler.

2. **Model-Driven Field Helpers**: By analyzing your GORM model structs, the CLI produces helpers for each field and association. These helpers form building blocks for filtering, updating, ordering, and associating dataâ€”equipping you with reusable, strongly typed code snippets.

Together, these two generators eliminate much of the routine work and risks involved in writing raw SQL or dynamic queries.

## Key Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

- **Compile-Time Safety**: Mistyped field names, mismatched parameter types, or invalid query syntax are caught before your program ever runs.
- **Better Discoverability**: Generated APIs and field helpers are auto-completed by modern IDEs, making it faster and less error-prone to build queries and updates.
- **Seamless GORM Integration**: Built explicitly for GORM users, keeping idiomatic Go and integration smooth.
- **Supports Complex Associations**: From has-one to many-to-many, association helpers give you expressive operations for related data.
- **SQL Template DSL**: Embed conditional and dynamic SQL directly in your interfaces, with GORM CLI handling parsing and generation.

---

## How GORM CLI Works: At a High Level

- You write **interface definitions** in Go with method comments containing SQL templates.
- You define your **GORM models** as usual.
- Running the CLI (`gorm gen -i ./input -o ./output`) **parses your interfaces and models, then generates code**:
  - Query interfaces turned into concrete, generic Go types.
  - Field and association helpers built from struct fields.
- Your application code then imports the generated package and interacts with the database through these fluent, type-safe APIs.

This smooth workflow replaces manual SQL crafting with reliable generated code that fits naturally into your Go projects.

---

## Illustrative Example

1. Define a query interface with SQL template comments:

```go
// Query[T any] interface with a type-safe GetByID
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)
}

// Define your model struct
 type User struct {
   gorm.Model
   Name string
   Age  int
 }
```

2. Generate the code by running:

```bash
gorm gen -i ./examples -o ./generated
```

3. Use the generated function:

```go
// Fetch user by ID safely
u, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

Behind the scenes, `GetByID` is now a fully typed query with SQL safely bound to parameters and verified at compile-time.

## Beyond Queries: Managing Associations with Confidence

GORM CLI also generates helpers to deal with complex associations:

- Create, update, unlink, and delete operations on `has one`, `has many`, `belongs to`, and `many2many` relations
- Fluent methods to create related records or batch operations
- Strong typing lets you safely navigate foreign keys and join tables without mistakes

For example, creating a user with pets or linking many languages is concise and safe:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(
    generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
    generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)
```

## Why You Should Care

**GORM CLI empowers your Go projects by:**

- **Reducing runtime errors** caused by incorrect queries
- **Increasing development speed** through discoverable, generated APIs
- **Simplifying maintenance** with standardized, generated code
- **Improving readability** by separating query logic in interfaces with embedded SQL templates
- **Enhancing integration** with GORM's native features

If you build Go apps relying on GORM, GORM CLI lets you write smarter, safer, and cleaner data access code, freeing you from the tedious and error-prone manual SQL construction.

## Next Steps

Start exploring how to define your models and query interfaces, then generate your first query code with GORM CLI. See the companion guides for `Defining Models & Query Interfaces` and `Generating Code` to quickly bootstrap your integration.
