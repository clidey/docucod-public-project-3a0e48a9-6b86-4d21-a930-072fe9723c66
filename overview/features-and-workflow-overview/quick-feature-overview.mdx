# Quick Feature Overview

Explore GORM CLI's essential capabilities that transform your Go projects using GORM into highly productive, type-safe, and maintainable codebases. This guide highlights core features like type-safe query API generation, model-driven field helpers, association operations, and configuration customization — all designed to help you write safer database code faster.

---

## Type-Safe Query API Generation

GORM CLI converts your Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates into concrete, type-safe query APIs. This key feature eliminates common runtime errors and improves code clarity by generating methods that reflect your SQL intentions with full compiler validation.

- **Write interfaces naturally:** Define methods with SQL templates as comments to express your queries.
- **Automatic context injection:** Methods gain `context.Context` transparently to support modern Go patterns.
- **Dynamic SQL templates:** Utilize placeholders (`@@table`, `@param`), conditional blocks (`{{if}}`, `{{where}}`), and loops (`{{for}}`) in your comments for flexible queries.

**Example:**
```go
// Query interface with SQL templates
type Query[T any] interface {
  // SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
  GetByID(id int) (T, error)

  // WHERE name=@name AND age=@age
  FilterByNameAndAge(name string, age int)

  // UPDATE with dynamic SET
  UpdateUser(user User, id int) error
}
```

The generated implementation provides strongly typed methods that integrate smoothly with `gorm.DB` and return idiomatic Go results.

## Model-Driven Field Helpers

From your GORM model structs, GORM CLI generates fluent, strongly typed field helpers for predicates (filters), updates, and ordering — enabling you to build expressive queries without manually crafting SQL.

- **Basic fields:** Support for common types like integers, strings, booleans, time, nullable types, and custom mappers.
- **Field predicates:** Methods such as `.Eq()`, `.Like()`, `.Between()`, `.IsNull()` facilitate common query operations easily.
- **Update setters:** Fluent methods like `.Set()`, `.Incr()`, and `.SetExpr()` empower safe updates while preventing mistakes.

**Example predicates and setters:**
```go
// Usage example
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Name.Eq("alice"),
        generated.User.Age.Between(18, 40)).
  Update(ctx)

// Create example
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
      generated.User.Age.Set(25)).
  Create(ctx)
```

---

## Association Operation Support

GORM CLI enhances your models with specially generated association helpers to handle related data with compile-time safety and ease.

Supported operations for associations include:

- **Create:** Insert and link related records in one fluent operation.
- **CreateInBatch:** Batch insert and associate multiple related records.
- **Update:** Modify associated records based on conditions.
- **Unlink:** Remove association links without deleting data.
- **Delete:** Delete associated rows or join records cleanly.

Operations automatically respect the semantics of `belongs to`, `has one`, `has many`, and `many2many` relations.

**Example workflows:**
```go
// Create a user with an associated pet
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(generated.User.Name.Set("alice"),
      generated.User.Pets.Create(generated.Pet.Name.Set("fido")),
  ).
  Create(ctx)

// Update a pet's name for a given user
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("fido")).
    Update(generated.Pet.Name.Set("rex")),
  ).
  Update(ctx)

// Unlink all pets from a user
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Unlink()).
  Update(ctx)

// Delete old pets conditionally
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("old")).Delete()).
  Update(ctx)
```

This direct, fluent API helps avoid error-prone manual SQL and streamlines relationship management.

## Configuration Customization

GORM CLI respects flexible, package-level configuration allowing you to tailor generation to your project's needs.

- **Output paths:** Define where generated code appears.
- **Selection filters:** Include/exclude interfaces or structs by pattern or type.
- **Custom field mappings:** Override field helpers for specific Go types or struct tags.
- **File-level control:** Limit generation scope at the file versus package level.

**Sample config snippet:**
```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  OutPath: "examples/output",
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  FieldTypeMap: map[any]any{
    sql.NullTime{}: field.Time{},
  },
  FieldNameMap: map[string]any{
    "json": JSON{},
  },
}
```

This fine control ensures the generator fits your code structure seamlessly.

## Seamless Workflow with GORM

GORM CLI outputs integrate directly with the `gorm.io/gorm` package, enabling efficient use alongside existing GORM code.

- Starts with your models and query interfaces.
- Generates type-safe, idiomatic Go code.
- Use generated APIs directly with GORM `*gorm.DB` instances.

**Simple call example:**
```go
user, err := generated.Query[User](db).GetByID(ctx, 123)
```

**Use field helpers for queries:**
```go
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).
  Find(ctx)
```

This smooth integration minimizes the learning curve and preserves your existing GORM workflows.

## Summary

GORM CLI's core features empower you to write safer, clearer, and more maintainable Go code with GORM by:

- Generating type-safe query interfaces from simple Go interfaces annotated with SQL templates.
- Creating fluent, strongly typed field helpers from your models automatically.
- Offering powerful and safe association operations.
- Allowing configuration for tailored generation.
- Integrating tightly with standard GORM APIs.

Unlock faster development, reduced runtime errors, and improved code clarity with these features.
