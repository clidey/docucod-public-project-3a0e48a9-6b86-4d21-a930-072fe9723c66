# Scalability and Performance Considerations

GORM CLI empowers Go developers to generate highly efficient, scalable, and type-safe database querying code. This page focuses specifically on how GORM CLI's generated code enables high performance and scalable querying while minimizing runtime overhead. It further discusses the compile-time safety benefits and offers best practices tailored for working with large models and high-throughput applications.

## The Value of Compile-Time Safety in Performance

GORM CLI’s primary advantage lies in eliminating runtime SQL mistakes through **compile-time safety**. By generating strongly typed, interface-driven query APIs and model-driven field helpers, developers avoid costly runtime errors and improve the reliability of their database access layer. This safety net allows your application to:

- Avoid costly runtime panics or bugs caused by query mismatches.
- Achieve predictable query execution plans through well-defined methods.
- Optimize performance by shifting error detection from runtime to compile time.

In effect, your applications become more resilient and maintainable at scale, which is often the greatest source of performance stability in database-centric programs.

## How GORM CLI Supports High-Performance Querying

### 1. Static Generation of Type-Safe APIs

The GORM CLI tool transforms your Go interfaces with embedded SQL templates into optimized Go methods. These methods are generated with:

- Direct bindings of parameters, avoiding reflection or dynamic SQL string assembly at runtime.
- Strongly typed method signatures, which reduce overhead from type assertions and conversions.
- Compile-time checked SQL templates that ensure queries are logically and syntactically valid before runtime.

For example, a method like:

```go
// SELECT * FROM @@table WHERE id=@id
GetByID(id int) (T, error)
```

compiles directly into an efficient query method that does not rely on runtime string formatting or fragile query construction.

### 2. Fluent and Efficient Field Helpers

GORM CLI generates **field helpers**: strongly typed predicate and setter structs and methods for each model field. These helpers are used in GORM query expressions to:

- Compose predicates clearly without inline string SQL.
- Reuse filters efficiently.
- Avoid reflection or generic parsing at runtime.

Example:

```go
users, err := gorm.G[User](db).Where(generated.User.Age.Gt(18)).Find(ctx)
```

This compiles to low-overhead SQL building operations, minimizing runtime allocations.

### 3. Efficient Association Handling

The generated association helpers allow for bulk operations (`CreateInBatch`), conditional updates, and unlink/delete semantics with minimal query overhead.

Batching association operations reduces database round trips and improves throughput for mass data writes, which is essential in large-scale systems.

## Best Practices for Large Models and High-Throughput Applications

As your models grow and query volume rises, consider these strategies to maintain peak performance:

### 1. Selective Generation Through Configuration

Use `genconfig.Config` to filter which interfaces and structs to generate to avoid bloated output and compilation times:

```go
var _ = genconfig.Config{
  IncludeInterfaces: []any{"Query*"},
  ExcludeStructs: []any{"*DTO"},
}
```

Generating only relevant query APIs and models reduces generated code complexity and runtime binary size.

### 2. Optimize SQL Templates for Minimal Overhead

- Use the template DSL's conditional directives like `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` to tailor queries only to needed parameters.
- Avoid excessive dynamic SQL string manipulation during queries.
- Leverage the compile-time parsing to produce fixed query strings with parameter bindings.

Example:

```go
// UPDATE @@table
// {{set}}
//   {{if user.Name != ""}} name=@user.Name, {{end}}
// {{end}}
// WHERE id=@id
UpdateUser(user User, id int) error
```

### 3. Leverage Bulk Operations

Batch inserts and updates reduce the overhead of multiple round trips:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Set(generated.User.Languages.CreateInBatch([]models.Language{{Code: "EN"}, {Code: "FR"}})).
  Update(ctx)
```

Batching is particularly important for many-to-many associations and large related datasets.

### 4. Use Where Conditions Smartly on Associations

Applying granular filters to association operations prevents unnecessary large writes or deletes:

```go
gorm.G[User](db).
  Where(generated.User.ID.Eq(1)).
  Set(generated.User.Pets.Where(generated.Pet.Name.Eq("fido")).Update(generated.Pet.Name.Set("rex"))).
  Update(ctx)
```

Filtering ensures updates and deletes target only intended rows, improving safety and minimizing lock contention.

## Understanding Runtime Overhead Minimization

GORM CLI’s generation process avoids runtime overhead typical in handwritten, dynamic string-based queries:

- Query methods avoid reflection by leveraging generated Go code with exact type signatures.
- Field helpers produce predicate expressions using statically-typed structs, eliminating runtime interpretation.
- SQL templates resolve to parameterized queries at compile-time, reducing runtime parsing and string concatenation.

These mechanisms contribute to faster execution and lower memory footprint in high-load scenarios.

## Troubleshooting Performance-Related Issues

<Tip>
If queries behave unexpectedly slow:

- Verify that generated SQL uses appropriate WHERE clauses and indexes.
- Use database EXPLAIN plans to identify bottlenecks unrelated to GORM CLI code.
- Ensure batch operations are used instead of repeated single inserts/updates.
- Check that associations are only linked/unlinked as needed to avoid excessive FK updates.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Overly large generated code might slow compilation:

- Use `IncludeInterfaces` and `ExcludeStructs` in genconfig to reduce scope.
- Split large monolithic models into smaller logical domains.
</Tip>

## Summary

GORM CLI is designed not only for safer database access but also for scalable, performant querying by shifting complexity from runtime to compile time. By following best practices in selective generation, optimized template usage, batching, and conditioned association operations, you can build expansive applications that maintain responsiveness and robustness under heavy database workloads.
