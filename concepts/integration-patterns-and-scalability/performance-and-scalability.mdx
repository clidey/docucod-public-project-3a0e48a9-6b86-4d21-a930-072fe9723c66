# Performance and Scalability Considerations

Understanding how GORM CLI-generated code impacts your project’s performance and scalability is essential for building reliable and maintainable applications. This guide surveys the key aspects affecting both compile-time and runtime behavior, and offers best practices to structure models and queries that scale smoothly as your codebase grows.

---

## 1. Overview of Performance Impact

GORM CLI generates type-safe query APIs and model-driven field helpers that introduce additional code layers for compile-time safety and improved developer ergonomics. While the generated code adds abstractions, it is carefully designed to minimize overhead and integrate seamlessly with GORM’s efficient ORM runtime.

### 1.1 Compile-Time Considerations

- **Code Generation Volume:** Larger projects with many interfaces and models naturally generate more code, increasing compile times. However, the generation process is optimized to only regenerate changed files and apply include/exclude filters.
- **Type Safety Benefits:** The upfront cost in code size is offset by compile-time validation of queries and invocations, reducing runtime errors and debugging time.
- **Configuration Effects:** Using generation configuration to whitelist or blacklist interfaces and structs helps manage code volume and compilation duration by generating only what is needed.

### 1.2 Runtime Characteristics

- **Fluent API Efficiency:** The generated fluent and context-aware APIs wrap GORM's native methods with minimal additional logic, preserving the performance characteristics of the underlying GORM layer.
- **SQL Template Expansion:** SQL templates compile into efficient Go code that constructs query strings dynamically but safely, avoiding unnecessary string buffer reallocations and repeated parameter construction.
- **Field Helper Usage:** Model-driven field helpers generate optimized predicates and setters, utilizing database driver interfaces and GORM’s schema conventions to maintain efficient query generation.

<Info>
GORM CLI does not introduce additional database roundtrips or network overhead beyond what your queries require—it focuses on type-safe code generation for safer runtime execution.

## 2. Code Generation and Its Scalability

How you define your models, interfaces, and configuration can significantly influence the scalability of generated code.

### 2.1 Struct and Interface Quantity

- Projects with many models and interfaces will generate proportionally more files and types.
- Apply `IncludeInterfaces` and `ExcludeInterfaces` config options to minimize unnecessary generation. For example, exclude deprecated or unused interfaces to reduce build size.

### 2.2 Model Complexity and Associations

- Complex models with deep association trees generate extensive field helpers, which may increase code volume but simplify relational operations at runtime.
- Association helpers enable batch operations and conditional unlinking/deletion, offering scalable patterns that replace error-prone manual handling.

### 2.3 Template SQL Complexity

- More complex SQL templates (with nested `{{if}}`, `{{for}}`, `{{where}}`, and `{{set}}` blocks) generate more intricate Go code to build queries.
- Keep SQL templates concise and focused; large, deeply nested templates may increase generated code size and slow compilation.

## 3. Best Practices for Scalability

Adopt these best practices to ensure efficient and scalable usage of GORM CLI-generated code.

### 3.1 Use Configuration Strategically

- **Whitelist Critical Interfaces:** Limit generation to essential interfaces using `IncludeInterfaces`.
- **Exclude Legacy or Auxiliary Structs:** Use `ExcludeStructs` to prevent generating unnecessary helpers for DTOs or legacy models.
- **File-Level Configs:** Employ `FileLevel` configurations to isolate generation scope and reduce overhead in large projects.

### 3.2 Structure Models for Clarity and Performance

- Flatten deeply nested or embedded structs only if necessary; excessive anonymous embedding inflates field helpers.
- Properly tag fields with `gorm` and `gen` tags to guide field helper generation and avoid unwanted complexity.

### 3.3 Simplify SQL Templates

- Avoid redundant conditions and complex templating when simpler queries suffice.
- Use `{{where}}` and `{{set}}` blocks to produce dynamic queries without excess branching.
- Harness parameter binding (`@param`) to optimize query plans and prevent injection risks.

### 3.4 Incremental Code Generation

- During development, generate code incrementally targeting changed packages or files to reduce compile overhead and improve feedback cycles.

### 3.5 Leverage Association Helpers Wisely

- Use association operations such as `CreateInBatch`, `Unlink`, and `Delete` to perform batch updates efficiently rather than manual per-record operations.

## 4. Understanding Generated Code Impact

### 4.1 Generated File Structure

Each generated file contains:

- A concrete implementation of your query interfaces with type-safe methods.
- A collection of model-driven field helpers generated from struct types.

The generated code includes method bodies that efficiently construct SQL queries using Go `strings.Builder` and parameter slices to avoid costly intermediate allocations.

### 4.2 SQL Template Expansion

GORM CLI parses and transforms embedded SQL templates into procedural Go code featuring:

- Conditional blocks (`{{if}}` / `{{else}}`) that assemble SQL dynamically based on method parameters.
- Iterations (`{{for}}`) for batch query constructions.
- Parameter placeholders (`@param`, `@@table`, `@@column`) replaced safely with proper binding expressions.

This produces safe, optimized, and idiomatic Go code minimizing runtime overhead.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Overly Large Generated Codebase

- If compile times increase significantly, audit config filters to exclude non-critical interfaces and models.
- Modularize your project and generate code package-wise to avoid regenerating unnecessary files.

### 5.2 Complex SQL Templates Causing Slower Compilation

- Break down complex queries into smaller, focused interface methods.
- Avoid nested or repeated conditional blocks where possible.

### 5.3 Excessive Field Helper Generation

- Use the `FieldNameMap` and `FieldTypeMap` in `genconfig.Config` to customize helper generation.
- Disable generation of certain helpers by excluding structs or customizing their tags.

### 5.4 Runtime Performance Issues

- Review the complexity of generated queries and indexes on your database.
- Use generated APIs to compose precise queries, avoiding fetching unnecessary data.

<Tip>
Regularly monitor your build times and generated code sizes as your project grows to proactively adjust configurations and model designs.
